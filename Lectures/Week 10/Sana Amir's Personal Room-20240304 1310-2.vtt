00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Cool.

2 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.880
Okay.

3 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.719
We'll come back this is the 2nd, part of the lecture now we are going to go over some moment to finish your problems.

4 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.850
So, for a moment, the financial, what is this the 2nd, moment of failure is more to.

5 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:31.680
That's the mathematical definition. It is a geometric property of an area, used to determine the strength of a structure member or the location of force acting on a plate somewhere fluid.

6 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.820
So, a moment of inertia is basically the resistance of a structural element to undergo any change in this shape.

7 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.850
Size, it's a more definition of an area is known about instead portal access. We can find out more definition about any set of access.

8 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
Uh, by using the pattern of access there. Okay.

9 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:09.150
Moving forward, let us look at the how to find out the moment of inertia. If the curve defining, the boundary of the area is expressed as why is it going to affect? Then we selected a triangular differential elements such that it has a finite length and differentiated.

10 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:22.530
The elements should be located so that it intersects the curve at that arbitrary point. So, let's say the best thing to do about to finish here is that if you have to find a different issue about the X axis.

11 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
You can take a strip bottle to the X axis.

12 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:37.080
If you have to find a more differential about the Y, axis, you can take the strip bottle to the Y axis. Okay. So, uh, that would be the easiest thing to do.

13 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.580
Uh, he runs the gamut of inertia.

14 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.450
Uh, formulas, I access to Y square D. A. I. is able to export.

15 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
Okay, so if you take a strip that is horizontal.

16 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.400
The length of the strip is X. the height is the Y.

17 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.500
And it is making a moment of why so I, X is equal to.

18 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.740
Why square? D. okay.

19 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.110
If you take moment a strip, which is parallel to the Y, axis.

20 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.920
Now, in this case, the height of the ship is why.

21 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.420
Horizontal distance is the X, so.

22 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.870
To find that moment of inertia about the Y, axis.

23 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.460
You have to take moment of this area, you know, with the respect to the Y, axis using X.

24 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.020
So this would be X Square. D okay.

25 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.160
So, to stay on to determine parallel access to them.

26 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.480
This is a file access data access data is used.

27 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.710
If you already know the moment of inertia about the central access.

28 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.520
Then you can just add this term a device Square.

29 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.320
To find a way to finish out about a patent set of access with is a difference between X dash and existences.

30 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.770
Okay, um, this sort of figure or table it will be given to you already in the exam.

31 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay, uh, the reason this is given to you is that we don't expect you to actually remember, you know, all these formulas. So, uh, we would be giving this to you so that.

32 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.200
You can use this more about the central access. You can use these values in the file.

33 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.880
Now, we have 2 problems for ice section. We have, for example, 5 examples 6.

34 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:46.290
I would like to go over. I mean, we can do either 1 of the 2 problems, but let us do this example. So, here you have an ice section. This is the X axis is the, this is the central axis.

35 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.870
This ticket is symmetrical, so it's very easy to determine where the centroid and X axis for the shape and centroid Y, axis of the ship might be.

36 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.200
The dimensions are the web complete is.

37 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.130
From top until those, this access is 200.

38 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.390
From bottom until here, it's 200. this height is 20 and the site is 20 and the thickness is basically.

39 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.840
Of the thickness of the web the vertical part is the web and the horizontal part is the.

40 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.870
So, the thickness of the whole section is just 20.

41 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.770
This distance is 150. this, this, this is 150.

42 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.189
So, what you can do is that you can convert this into, um, 3, rectangles.

43 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:34.769
Is a horizontal 2, horizontal and 1 rectangle.

44 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:41.429
For the Y, axis more differentiate about the Y axis. If you notice the Y axis.

45 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:47.789
The Y, axis is passing through the centroid by centroid for all the examples. So.

46 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.909
For the why we need to finish up we don't need to.

47 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.679
Applied by access tail. Okay. But for the X axis.

48 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:58.769
If you notice this is internal x axis.

49 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:05.969
And, yeah, for the vertical rectangle, it passes through the centroid, but for this and this.

50 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:12.449
For the horizontal rectangles the X axis central relax access is different. Okay.

51 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.219
So, we are going to be applying peril access to here.

52 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.419
Let us 1st, find out more definition about the X axis.

53 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.969
Want to finish off a rectangle about the central x axis is by 12.

54 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.279
So so for this rectangle.

55 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:41.939
And for this rectangle, the distance between the X axis is the X axis. Okay. From this point to.

56 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.409
The centre of this rectangle it is 190. how did I know.

57 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.999
I know that from this point, until the base is 200.

58 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:58.139
Thickness is 20. half of it is 10. so 200-1090.

59 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:04.769
Okay, so the parallel distance between the 2 axes and 19 now, we will just apply by.

60 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:10.379
Mind you this is the yeah, this is the amount of an issue about the central by 12.

61 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:21.809
So, for the top, and the bottom, we will do 1 calculation, and we will just multiply it with 2 like this. Okay. So the calculation is that the supply file access to them.

62 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.739
I X, more definition about the centroid and X axis.

63 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:30.269
For the this or this, you can use either. 1 of them is equal to.

64 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:34.409
Issue by 12 about the central relaxes, which is.

65 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.609
300 times 20 usually by 12.

66 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:42.929
Last area area is equal to 300 times 20.

67 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:50.159
Times the transcript is principle Square, 1900 Square, but that is the more definition about the X axis.

68 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:57.179
Okay, moment to financial about the X axis of this vertical web.

69 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:00.779
Is simply be achieved by 12? No. Need to transfer.

70 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:09.599
Because this access of the overall section is the same as the X axis for the vertical bar. Right? So this is simply.

71 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.919
Which is 20 H, which is 360.

72 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.069
Why 316? This height is 360.

73 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:21.629
Okay, this high this for the web is 360.

74 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:29.699
Total is 400-20 for this -20 for the bottom you will have 3 system. So bye.

75 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:37.109
Similarly, now we have for the horizontal for the vertical.

76 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:45.359
2 horizontal changes, so you will multiply moment of inertia by 2 last moment of inertia of the center.

77 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:45.359 --> 00:07:51.269
Y, axis center vertical. Well, we will give you total moment to finish.

78 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:57.419
To find a woman to finish about the Y axis. It is just by 12.

79 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:57.419 --> 00:08:01.769
hbq by 12 of each of the rectangles. Okay.

80 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:08.939
So, we will, we are not going to transfer it because Y, axis is a central access. There is no transfer distance.

81 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:15.599
So all of them you will calculate by 12 for the horizontal 2, horizontal ones.

82 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:21.389
And then 1 vertical ones, you will get the for the.

83 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:25.919
Similarly, this example is very similar.

84 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:33.239
To what we have, I think you will do this in the tutorial also most likely.

85 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:38.999
So, in this example, we will do want to finish by the composite method.

86 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:53.729
If you look, we have this solid blue area. Okay. It consists of a triangle and a rectangle and then the circle is taken out of it. You have to find a more differentiate about the X axis and definition about the Y, axis.

87 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:58.769
So, I will just let, you know how this is to be done then you can do this yourself.

88 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:04.979
So, basically you will find a moment of inertia about the centroid Alexa access for.

89 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:08.759
Each of the shapes what we can do is that because.

90 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:13.559
There is a hollow circle here, so you can just, um, sorry.

91 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:22.949
I want to use a different color, not this 1. let me use a different yeah.

92 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:26.309
So, what you can do is you can fill this up.

93 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:33.089
Okay, you can just fill this out and now you have a solid.

94 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:40.199
Can you have a solid chip in this way? So if you look at this, um, shape.

95 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:50.339
Or the triangle, we know that the Central is at 8 by 3 by 3. we have, I have explained this to you over here then for the rectangle.

96 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:56.939
Uh, you know, the moment of inertia, we're trying to find it about the X axis. So that's why we are looking at the why distances?

97 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:56.939 --> 00:09:59.969
So, for the rectangle, it is at 100.

98 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:59.969 --> 00:10:04.289
And then for this cycle, the centroid is at 100, right?

99 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:07.679
So, what this means is that, um.

100 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:10.949
For the triangle.

101 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:15.569
The finishes here. Okay. And what is this distance?

102 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:22.319
This distance is 200, because a total height of the triangle is 200. so be by 3 H by 3.

103 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:28.889
So, 200 divided by 3, and then for the rectangle and the circle, it is 100. okay.

104 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:36.299
So, we will find out moment of inertia, uh, for the triangle, and this about their own centroid access, right?

105 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:40.679
And then you will just transfer it to this.

106 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:46.199
So, for the triangle by 36, how do I know that? Well.

107 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:46.199 --> 00:10:52.349
This shape here see, this is a triangle moment of inertia. Here is 36.

108 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:52.349 --> 00:10:55.859
Okay, 226 remember the is the.

109 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:55.859 --> 00:11:00.629
Access panel to the X axis. So here.

110 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:16.049
Is equal to 300 by 36 this is the of the triangle about it's x axis. Then this is the area of the triangle hop into height and this is a vertical distance 200 divided by 3.

111 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:16.049 --> 00:11:21.809
This is the central X access for the triangle and you are transferring it to 100 by 3.

112 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:25.169
Right. So that's that's there's that.

113 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:28.859
Then you can do moment of inertia for the rectangle.

114 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:28.859 --> 00:11:44.849
It'd be by 12, 300 times 200. by 12. we are transferring at a distance of 100 so, area times device square and then circle 1 definition is via 4 by 4 inspired Square.

115 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:44.849 --> 00:11:48.569
And this is the area, and this is a transfer distance 100.

116 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:59.129
Answer this, these 2 will be added up and then the circle is going to be subtracted to give us some more definition about the X axis.

117 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:59.129 --> 00:12:07.589
Similarly, you can solve it for about the Y axis, but then now all the distances.

118 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:13.739
Will be taken with respect to classes so this distance is 450.

119 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:13.739 --> 00:12:19.829
For the rectangle, and for the subtle both for this 1 is equal to.

120 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:23.939
Um, if we try and go to the Central right here.

121 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:23.939 --> 00:12:27.689
Right so this distance is to be by 3.

122 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:27.689 --> 00:12:32.459
Which is 200 this distance is be by 3 it this 1. so.

123 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:38.489
To 100 this distance is 1. so transfer distance is basically 200.

124 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:41.819
Okay, you know, this from the properties.

125 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:41.819 --> 00:12:47.669
So, similarly you can solve for more definition about the Y, axis.

126 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:55.079
Okay, thank you so much. This is these are the problems. Um, most of these problems are.

127 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:55.079 --> 00:13:04.199
These problems are not hard, but they do require a little bit of thought process how you should be taking this trip how you're going to calculate the.

128 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:07.949
Differential area how you're going to take the moment about the X axis.

129 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:20.189
So, the central amount of inertia is there these problems? I'm, if I find more lectures, like, my previously recorded lectures, I will put them on on.

130 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:25.379
Otherwise, in we are going to do some good revision of this topic as well.

131 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:33.359
Okay, I'm also going to put some free recorded lecture for, uh, energy, kinetic energy and potential energy.

132 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:33.359 --> 00:13:40.829
We did this topic in class today, so we didn't finish the lecture, but because we had time we finished early. So I had.

133 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:45.209
Started the next topic also, so I'm going to put that also online.

134 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:50.069
For you to watch, thank you so much, have a lovely day.

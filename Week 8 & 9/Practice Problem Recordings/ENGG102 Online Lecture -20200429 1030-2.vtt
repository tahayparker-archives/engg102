1
00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:14.154
So, now we are at the second half of the lecture, the system, it will be doing some problems the leftover from the tutorial spots first.

2
00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:43.944
So.

3
00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:15.504
So.

4
00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:26.784
Yesterday we did the first problem second problem.

5
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:32.935
You can do this now.

6
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:43.284
Located the centroid of the cross sectional area will be this is a big cross section. It's the length of the.

7
00:02:46.860 --> 00:03:00.055
So this is a built up being built up, means that when several parts are joined together, the blue or nail, so also any sort of a connection. Okay so, here you can see that they are voltage together.

8
00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:16.555
I'll have to find out the why centroid is simple because see, the Y, axis is symmetrical. I mean, the object is symmetrical about what? Axes? Yeah. If you wanna watch it later, you can just watch it later. I will upload it.

9
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.895
Since the way the X bar is, you.

10
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:36.925
Because the distinction is symmetrical about both access oh, with this X axis, which we have shown at the bottom. This is not the same for X axis.

11
00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:43.615
So, where does a central x axis that we will know by calculating? The Y, Y bar isn't the vertical direction.

12
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.025
So, we don't know where this is. Maybe it is here. Let's just say.

13
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:57.655
This is what we have to find out this is the centroid x axis and why is the same as others?

14
00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.925
Okay, so now to do that what we have to do is let meet up.

15
00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.074
So, what we can do is that we can use a composite data method, so we can divide it.

16
00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:23.935
So, this can be, let's say this area, one and two, they are the same and this is a number three and then this is area number four, right? So.

17
00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:29.545
The formula for the central centroid formula is this one.

18
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:46.644
It is why bar equal to sum of eight times some of so we will find out why but for each one of them. Okay.

19
00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:58.345
And then simply multiplied by eighty. So, now, for, let's calculate the for this one. Why buy this here? This is.

20
00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:14.334
Changes right and yes, I, then this one also is that three inches? Right? What about this one? This one is here.

21
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.675
So, it is six. The thickness is one. Oh, so it is at five point five inches.

22
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.475
Fixes until the top yeah, it's a six.

23
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:38.185
It says at the center, right? So the thickness off this is one inch. So that means from the bottom until here, it is five point five.

24
00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:43.944
Basically, whenever you are finding out Central, you are, what is central it is moment off.

25
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:52.944
Moment of the section, right? So you are a Times why you take a moment of the area. So we are taking moment about excesses.

26
00:05:52.944 --> 00:06:01.824
So, a one this Adrian multiplied by the moment on this area, multi revenue momentum, this multiplied by its momentum and multiply by its moment.

27
00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:05.754
Add all of them together divide by total we'll give you.

28
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:19.615
The total overall century how much is this distance? Assistance is six plus three. This is nine into six and it is nine.

29
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.644
So, now we will just put it into the formula. You can also construct a table.

30
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.475
It's frozen.

31
00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:57.745
It's fine. So.

32
00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:07.795
So, now you can either construct a table, so to construct a table, you can, you know, basically, this is a question you have to do.

33
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:15.175
When you have four shapes, right? So you can to the.

34
00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:27.204
So shape, number shape number one, two, three, four, and then the area, what are the areas?

35
00:07:27.595 --> 00:07:37.254
Area of vertical shape is six times one the two vertical and this one is all six times one and this one is also six times one.

36
00:07:37.254 --> 00:07:51.295
So all of them are six, so all of them are basically six, six, six, six, six, and then their wives. So the first two are three and then five point five and then nine. Okay.

37
00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:54.355
And then you just multiply them.

38
00:07:55.259 --> 00:08:06.865
You would multiply so eight times. Go ahead. You, what you need is this and this so you multiply this you multiply those. You multiply this you multiply. So, eighteen, eighteen.

39
00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:21.685
And then you sum this up and you divide so you will get this and then you divided by signoff. That's one way of doing it. The other way is I prefer this way, because I don't mistakes like this.

40
00:08:21.714 --> 00:08:35.965
But anyway, this is the other one. So that you just put it in the equation so area times, this plus this times, this plus this time is okay, so multiply by three showing. Two times.

41
00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:46.014
Six the two is there because they are two vertical chips. Six times. One is an area and three is momentum and then five point five momentum. Six times one area. Nine is the momentum six times. One times.

42
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.654
Some of the areas do I did get five point one to five inches.

43
00:08:53.514 --> 00:08:56.424
The problems that are related to.

44
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:12.565
A compose a section by central going forward this problem of the composite area how we,

45
00:09:12.654 --> 00:09:13.524
how we can do that.

46
00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:20.004
We can do that. I can divide to like this and then we have a whole circle here.

47
00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:30.205
I can do is that I can zoom it to be solid change.

48
00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:49.764
Oh, you can make it so let's make a change. And here also you make it solid the distance from here and did hear the semi circle one point. And the small is one.

49
00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:55.585
I know this one subtracted.

50
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:04.105
Well, this is wonderful. Subjective and the bottom is here.

51
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.715
This distance is one same as a white.

52
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.304
Why is this? Why basically.

53
00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:32.100
What you add is what you subtract now, you know, where is this? Where are the centers? So for shape number one yeah. So I, it centroid is here, right?

54
00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:35.424
In this farmer, you have to find out both X and Y.

55
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.789
So, if I, if I look at the distances, how much is this distance? This is one.

56
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:54.235
And how much is a horizontal distance, which is also right because for a triangle toy, this is, let's say, and this is H, okay.

57
00:10:54.625 --> 00:11:01.404
So, the longer site is to be by three and the shorter side is B, by two, three by three is one.

58
00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:06.115
This is your centroid for trying.

59
00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:16.884
How will you know that when we are taking moments and that we always do it from the reference axis. So, in reality is this, this is going to be measured from here.

60
00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:24.264
Plus one that is full, particularly it is one, because it is being already being measured from X.

61
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:38.815
This distance is three plus one. What about the second distance? The second one is here. This is easy. This distance is one point five. And what is what? Typical distance what? Tickle is one point.

62
00:11:40.284 --> 00:11:44.394
And the third one now, this is a semi circle for the semi circle.

63
00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:57.595
This distance is for our over three four are over three by.

64
00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:07.195
The Central is here, so this distance, or this is for radius is one.

65
00:12:08.159 --> 00:12:19.434
Divided by three by four or three point that's the central. And it's major directly from the Y axis. And what particularly what does this distance particularly is one point five.

66
00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:33.745
Now, you can either construct a table again. Oh, sorry. And for this, so, for this horizontally, the distance is zero, right? It is zero.

67
00:12:34.945 --> 00:12:37.884
And particularly the distance is one point five.

68
00:12:39.205 --> 00:12:40.884
And this is minus of Asia.

69
00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:48.054
The other thing I wanna mention is the science all the distances,

70
00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:53.784
the vertical in this direction above X axis there positive horizontally this,

71
00:12:53.784 --> 00:12:58.524
for our three by negative because the shape lies towards the negative side.

72
00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:07.884
That's the only negative here. The area's negative export is zero by by response to one point. Okay, so go ahead.

73
00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:18.000
Right. Same thing is done what I've done here and simply then you put it in this formula and you put it in this formula. Okay.

74
00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:29.664
So a one by one minus for a semi circle minus forever three by area its squared by the square by to.

75
00:13:32.184 --> 00:13:40.554
A square by two, semi circle. Sorry? Not. It's if you have a diameter, it's by default.

76
00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:53.605
And then you have this, this is one point, five, three times three for the rectangle and basically this is for your triangle and this zero times that's the or a negative.

77
00:13:56.365 --> 00:13:59.455
Buyer square by the square by four.

78
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:03.715
Sorry, what am I saying area.

79
00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:11.544
Will do by our square right? And is equal to D by to.

80
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:20.154
So, ID square by four by four by four is the moment of.

81
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:35.934
So, okay, so, and downwards we have, this is for, you know, the third so the shape, the semi circle, and then you have the rectangle and the triangle and then the minus of the area.

82
00:14:37.259 --> 00:14:45.534
So, this deal is there, because the expert is, you know, for for this sucker for this sucker, the X bar is.

83
00:14:46.945 --> 00:15:01.495
Now, coming to us, why bother? Okay coming to us? Why bother again? The same thing for the semi circle.

84
00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:13.164
Then this is for the square and this is for the triangle and this is the negative negative area. Which positive why? Because why is above all devise?

85
00:15:13.164 --> 00:15:19.164
Are in this example above the XX and this is some of the idea. So you get your central.

86
00:15:27.174 --> 00:15:30.054
These are the two problems we did the semi circle.

87
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:38.904
He also did this problem I think last did this from he did this.

88
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.085
So this now,

89
00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:42.595
we have to do,

90
00:15:43.674 --> 00:15:44.245
in the moment,

91
00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:46.975
I'll finish up the composite area of the centroid and Y,

92
00:15:46.975 --> 00:16:00.024
axis they're asking this is the s*** they're asking that find out the want me to finish about the Y axis is shape is symmetrical about the Y.

93
00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:05.215
axis no need to find out the Central is basically.

94
00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:19.014
To find a moment of so, if you look at, where does the central access for each central access for the ship is here.

95
00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:32.634
So, yeah, access different why is the same? So no need to transfer using out of access to them because we have final moment of inertia about the Y, axis.

96
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:43.674
Similarly, for this s***, now, how can we do that for composite area while we can apply the same logic? So, what we can do is that we can fill up this area.

97
00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:50.514
So, let's fill up so you can fill up this area, right?

98
00:16:53.335 --> 00:17:03.414
Then you have one chip and the second big rectangle chip and then the shape is will be. It's moment to finish. I will be subtracted. This is how we can do this. Okay.

99
00:17:03.924 --> 00:17:11.815
So, for the triangle moment, inertia about the Y, axis, and then for this one, and then minus for this one. Okay.

100
00:17:12.325 --> 00:17:21.204
So the only problem is, for me to finish off the time, do we know a moment of Triangle? Well, if we have a triangle, any shape.

101
00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:32.065
These are it's editorial access, so want me to finish up for the triangle is by thirty six.

102
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:40.194
What what about a triangle that is like symmetrical? Why? So this triangle is different from the sort of trying.

103
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:53.184
Because here, the total axes are it'd be by three by three Y, axis about X axis. Yes, it's fine. It's be a two by thirty six. What about Y axis? It is different.

104
00:17:53.904 --> 00:18:07.825
So, although it looks like there's no need to transfer, but we do need to do that. Okay. So what we're going to do, we are going to divide this triangle into two parts.

105
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:20.065
So, like, this, we divide this triangle into two parts. Now, we can apply the attribute by thirty six. I will repeat this again.

106
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:26.575
See, two by thirty six I'm going to finish trying.

107
00:18:28.434 --> 00:18:39.775
This is applicable for these, these sort of triangles where the access and passing through out here.

108
00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:47.845
Like this yeah, what you have your Senatorial access for this big triangle is here.

109
00:18:49.704 --> 00:19:02.305
This is a different triangle what we can do it, we can divide into two parts when we divide into two parts, then it's simple then the centroid is here and yeah, it just beat you by thirty six or two by thirty six. Okay.

110
00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:15.865
So, whether it's six Y axis, it should be six. Then it is very simple. We can we can do that. Because now this matches with the situation, this triangle, this triangle has centered and why access here.

111
00:19:16.404 --> 00:19:28.585
So, the moment the financial is not by thirty six accesses is okay access speech you by thirty six because this is white. Do you understand this point that I'm trying to me?

112
00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:47.545
So now, however, once we do that, if we say that we do why we want to divide into two parts. Now, what happens is look at where the Y, axis is this is the same Y, axis.

113
00:19:48.384 --> 00:20:03.265
Where is the Y, axis for your triangles now? Well, they are here, it's here in here that means now for this situation, because you change something, so you need to transfer by this amount. So, how much is this amount?

114
00:20:04.015 --> 00:20:14.605
Well, let's look at the. It is hundred and fifty. So, this distance in red that I have pointed out, it is hundred and fifty divided by.

115
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.744
Hundred and fifty divided by three.

116
00:20:21.779 --> 00:20:26.184
Yeah, so yeah, no, it is fish teeth.

117
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:41.095
It's fifty, not one hundred, fifty millimeters, fifty millimeters, fifty millimeters on board.

118
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:46.404
Yes, but yeah, these are two different shapes. So fifty.

119
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.595
For one trying not for books.

120
00:20:53.244 --> 00:20:59.964
I mean, you have to see them separately. Okay you can, of course, make the calculation and then multiply it by two.

121
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:11.964
But I wouldn't say that this distance is one hundred. This distance is the distance that I pointed out is fifty, but fifteen on both sides. Yeah. Alright.

122
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:27.775
So, what about this trying or do we need to transfer for this triangle? No. So, Y, axis is here for the sheet and it matches with the overall Y axis also. So no need to transfer. Okay. So this is going to be by twelve.

123
00:21:28.224 --> 00:21:41.964
I would there is us, there is a rectangle inside that we need to subtract by by twelve, four, this triangle that we added to make the whole chips solid.

124
00:21:42.355 --> 00:21:56.545
Now we need to subtract. So, this one is the Y, axis this by access for the shape is the same as over on the axis. So, no, need spiral axis data. Next is that we just put everything in the equation.

125
00:21:57.984 --> 00:22:02.365
So, this is the equation moment of about the central axis.

126
00:22:04.134 --> 00:22:15.805
Plus, a, the X squared the transfer distance so we have two small triangles, each BQ by three, six. So let me show you if you have a triangle.

127
00:22:20.275 --> 00:22:31.255
So here is X axis is Y axis. This is and this is H, so about X axis. It is phq by thirty six.

128
00:22:32.369 --> 00:22:35.875
About why access it is by six.

129
00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:41.815
So, hbq by thirty six and you multiply by two because you have to triangles.

130
00:22:43.585 --> 00:22:51.384
This area off base to hide, and this is a fifty distance, right? So fifty times will see if you now put two hundred here, it will be wrong.

131
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.515
If this is going to be wrong, so fifty Square.

132
00:22:58.765 --> 00:23:00.775
And then overall you can multiply it by.

133
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.474
Calculation will be multiplied by two. All right.

134
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:23.664
Going further, you have another shape here bigger ten. So the bigger tangle is by twelve. Oh, sorry. hbq by twelve. Because moment of finish about is about the Y, axis each VQ by twelve.

135
00:23:26.035 --> 00:23:38.244
To see the zero distances, because this overlaps with the overall by access, minus in a small rectangle woman to finish. It has to be subtracted.

136
00:23:38.275 --> 00:23:43.944
So minus minus or you can write this plus this plus. But what this says negative.

137
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:56.095
So again, hbq by twelve and again, the transfer distance is zero. So, basically, this Tom, as you, we'll need to parallax. No, need for phylaxis, applying this.

138
00:23:56.154 --> 00:24:04.105
You get the moment of an issue about Y, axis, which is nine one four into ten is six millimeters raised to the power.

139
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.454
Well, that's the problem. And here you have to find out a moment. The next part is the same problem.

140
00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:30.595
Now you have to find a moment to finish it about the X axis to do that. Well, we don't we don't know where the central x axis. This is not the central access. This is just the reference access.

141
00:24:32.244 --> 00:24:45.384
Shape is symmetrical about why? So, the reference why in the central order, why are the same for each? But about X axis now? What's the what's the problem? What? The triangle it's central axis here.

142
00:24:49.015 --> 00:25:03.684
What is in this case, you don't need to divide the triangle is the X axis is passing through by three. Okay. So this triangle, whether you have this triangle or this triangle.

143
00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:17.904
Omit the financial by thirty six. Previously the problem was that we were talking about Y, axis Y, axis for this triangle is at some distance access for this triangle was right in the middle.

144
00:25:19.049 --> 00:25:25.974
It was not actually, it was not it was different, so that's why we divided into to watch for now.

145
00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:33.835
In this case, a VINO moment of of this triangle about this axis, that is be.

146
00:25:34.884 --> 00:25:46.404
Hq by thirty six. Okay. And where is this sent toward? How much is this distance? This is two hundred and forty.

147
00:25:48.029 --> 00:26:02.035
Divide it by three what about the big rectangle? So we can assume this to be like, a solid it and do the same thing negative in other one negative the ownership. Okay.

148
00:26:02.335 --> 00:26:12.474
So for the bigger one, it's X. axis is the highest, four hundred and fifty. So, what is four hundred and fifty divided by two to twenty five?

149
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.464
So, it's x axis is here.

150
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.095
It's x axis here. Alright.

151
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:40.164
And, and clearly is not going to be the same. The other one is also the same for the inner triangle, the X axis because, you know, they are overlapping. So, it's the same thing for the bigger and the small.

152
00:26:44.904 --> 00:26:48.450
A, this distance the inside distance. This is hi.

153
00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:59.964
So, it's how much one hundred and seventy five hundred and seventy five.

154
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.335
Two twenty five minus fifty it's hundred, so.

155
00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:21.684
Question is, where is the overall central order axis so that if that is here, that's just as human is here then we need to transfer all the moment of inertia or the triangle.

156
00:27:21.684 --> 00:27:24.865
We need to transfer it through this distance. This distance.

157
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:35.904
For the view is for the bigger rectangle, we need to transfer it through this distance and for the small rectangle again, we need to transfer to the same distance. This one.

158
00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:50.575
Okay, so we need to do these transfers the first step Howard, and this is to locate X Dash, which will locate X dash. We can do that by the composite that we, you've just done previously.

159
00:27:51.265 --> 00:28:00.384
Yeah, so this is, you can find out where the why virus. Okay, so this is all the areas. So this is eighty of the triangle.

160
00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:10.404
Off base into height into five thirty. So what is five thirty? We are measuring the.

161
00:28:11.609 --> 00:28:18.295
We're finding out the whiteboard from the base. Okay. Sorry I know this is annoying.

162
00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:30.265
So this is our base, so we will take this distance. That is five hundred and thirty is five thirty.

163
00:28:31.255 --> 00:28:44.065
So so we are taking because we are taking moment about this. Xx, is this one so whatever viable? We will find out that will also be from the same access. Okay it is not going to be from the top.

164
00:28:44.484 --> 00:28:51.744
You have the choice to take moments about the talk maybe but then fireball will be from the top. This will be five.

165
00:28:52.380 --> 00:29:01.464
So whatever access about which you are taking your distances or your moment same access is the one from which you will measure your central.

166
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:08.609
Well, yeah, we we find out by bar. Okay.

167
00:29:09.085 --> 00:29:21.505
And then the area for the bigger rectangle and then it's momenta and then the smaller one which we added it is actually, and then it's moment divided by all the areas. So why?

168
00:29:21.505 --> 00:29:25.525
But turns out to be three hundred to thirty three point seven.

169
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:41.365
My go back here this distance I bought is three, three, three point seven one. So now, you know, that this is three, three, three point seven one, minus two to five.

170
00:29:41.365 --> 00:29:53.125
You get this distance. Okay right and we know that this distance from here until here. It is five hundred and twenty, right?

171
00:29:53.755 --> 00:30:03.444
Five hundred and thirty minus triple three point. Seven one that will give you this distance battle access distance. Okay.

172
00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:11.634
So then now, we know the overall location of the X dash axis, the overall central axis, you know, the distances.

173
00:30:11.634 --> 00:30:20.634
So, we can, if we know that moment of inertia is the issue by thirty six for this triangle about it central access, we can transfer it to this axis.

174
00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:28.164
Because now we, you know, X, a, this distance in a direction. You can call it. Why.

175
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.095
So, putting it in this equation, what does this equation.

176
00:30:35.849 --> 00:30:45.025
Moment of about its access plus area into the transfer distance. So pH Q. by thirty six plus area.

177
00:30:46.855 --> 00:30:58.464
Half be sorry vh by two half. Bh into this is a transfer distance between the two access. Yeah, one ninety six point. Two, nine, whereas one ninety six point.

178
00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:05.065
Well, it says here okay. All these distances.

179
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.414
So, the overarching portal access is found to be.

180
00:31:12.744 --> 00:31:21.835
This is the centroid for the triangle, this distances one ninety six point two nine for these for the two rectangles. So this is a central access.

181
00:31:21.865 --> 00:31:29.394
So, this distance is hundred and eight point seven, both for the bigger and for this small, because, you know, they are together. They are overlap.

182
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:39.085
Yeah, you go back and you this so area and two hundred and eight point seven one for the trying.

183
00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:54.055
And then here for the a rectangle by twelve into area was negative we just added it. Okay. And all this term either.

184
00:31:54.055 --> 00:31:58.434
You you can basically you can take this positive, but then this plus sign, it should be.

185
00:31:59.605 --> 00:32:08.184
You have to subtract this moment of pleasure so times the transfer distance Square. This is basically your answer.

186
00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:16.855
So, you finished early, do you want to do you have some questions you want to repeat something?

187
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:35.934
Yes, so you need to practice on this, please the problems at least at least the problems that we are in the tutorials for the exams. This is minimum, please solve every problem or the exam.

188
00:32:36.835 --> 00:32:39.654
Otherwise it will be there would be a problem.

189
00:32:40.589 --> 00:32:44.484
I know that things are hard for you. I'm not sure.

190
00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:54.835
You know, changes and everything, but at least I assure you, if you do the problems that we have done in the tutorial.

191
00:32:56.009 --> 00:33:01.345
We'll be able to solve your example at least this is necessary.

192
00:33:02.545 --> 00:33:13.795
Ideally, you should go back to the book and so more examples there. So exercise problems. So please do your best and hope for the best. Okay.

193
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:27.174
So, thank you so much. I think this is enough for today. I'm also my throat is going. I'm dying, so I'll see you next week.

194
00:33:27.775 --> 00:33:32.214
Next week you're going to have your last question on the sent word and moment of inertia topic.

195
00:33:34.404 --> 00:33:49.164
And we will finish the potential energy chapter also. Okay. And then on the last day, hopefully, we will have a I mean, that will be left. So, on the last day, then I, I will go through some trust problems, method of going to method sections again.

196
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.345
Right Thank you so much.

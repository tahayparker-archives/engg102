00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Oh.

2 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.100
Hello.

3 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.169
Okay.

4 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:21.630
Okay, welcome everyone. This is week 9 of the semester.

5 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.820
And as I explained to you that I won't be able to do a live class.

6 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.820
Um, on campus, so therefore, therefore I'm recording this lecture.

7 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
We already had a little bit of introduction to the topic.

8 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.190
In the beginning of this class that was held online and, uh, now I am going to.

9 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.740
Refer to this lecture, this is on Central doesn't want to finish your problems.

10 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:58.170
We've already covered the critical part of centers among the financial last week. Today. We are just going to go over some more problems.

11 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.100
And hopefully this will be a good practice session for you and most of the problems.

12 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.950
I believe little bit of a calculation work for you to do, for example, how to.

13 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
The integration that will not be covered in this lecture.

14 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.870
However, what we will cover is basically all the rest of the steps.

15 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.250
What you have to do to find our central and what you have to do to find out who to finish here.

16 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.100
You will be doing more problems later on in the tutorial also.

17 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.430
So, if you look at the central procedure of analysis.

18 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.590
For central central gravity of any shape or object, you can determine it by the following steps.

19 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.920
The 1st step would be to determine and appropriate coordinate access. This is very important because you are measuring all your moment arms with respect to that access.

20 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.730
And you're finding out the centroid with respect to that access.

21 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.120
The 2nd would be to choose a differential element for integration. You can take a rectangular strip.

22 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.980
You can take it parallel to, um, any of the access or.

23 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:12.150
As I would say, for 20 of the access, uh, we will talk about it a little bit more when we sold for the problem. Sometimes it is more convenient to take this trip.

24 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.610
If let's say, you have to find out to take the trip to the.

25 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.900
Same goes from the furniture I have to take more of a definition about the X axis, take the ship to the expenses.

26 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.340
And other scenarios as we would see in problem number 1.

27 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.630
I will give you a tip how to do the, how to take the.

28 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.240
The potential element now locate the elements so that it touches any arbitrary point on the curve, such that it defines a boundary.

29 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.160
We can then find out the differential area of the rectangle.

30 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.150
And we also know where at the center of the rectangle we know that.

31 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.180
Said part of the rectangle, you know, the.

32 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.270
Is where are they located?

33 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.700
And then we integrate this over the entire area and divided by total area.

34 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:14.160
The differential area or integration, uh, limits we have to look at whether your strip is vertical horizontal and take the appropriate limits the boundaries for the.

35 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.360
Um, for the integration, there will be 2 extreme locations. Okay.

36 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:34.740
Now, 1 thing I missed here that you have to integrate in terms of the same variable as the differential thickness of the element. Okay. Now we will apply these steps on this example and hopefully it will be more clear to, you.

37 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.160
So, let us take a look at this example on 1.

38 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.050
The example, states that you have to look at the centroid of this shape, figure the shaded area.

39 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.010
You have to find out the accent and you have to find out though.

40 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.330
Why centroid okay now, what we can do is we can take a strip here.

41 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.620
So, I'm going to take, uh, a strip that this is.

42 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.190
My point is where you any back here.

43 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.460
I'm going to take a straight, let's say.

44 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.200
We're going to take a strip that is parallel to, let's say the X axis. Okay.

45 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.250
Now, for this trip to the X axis, what is the thickness? The thickness of the strip is.

46 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.769
The Y, right this sickness.

47 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:35.099
Of the stress that is equal to D. Y, and the length of the script is equal to.

48 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.399
X thanks. Okay.

49 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:48.479
So, length of the strip is equal to X significantly to D. D. why? So, the differential area of this trip will be equal to times X. D. Y right?

50 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.719
Okay.

51 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:04:51.719 --> 00:05:01.469
Equation of the curve the function is given by why is equal to execute. We can write this. Why is equal to execute as X is equal to why it is 2 part 103.

52 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:10.769
Now, the center, the Centers for this bar and bar, so centroid with respect to.

53 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.399
The Y, axis is the.

54 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.049
Is, of course, right this distance from here at this point.

55 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:25.259
With the center of this trip, this is equal to to.

56 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:33.599
Right. Vertically do we know the distance? Yes vertically we know the distance vertically is equal to why curly bar is equal to why?

57 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.529
So, now we can find out, um.

58 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:43.019
The export export will be going to times over.

59 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:50.099
Okay, we can put the value of is equal to X Y, you know, that length into height.

60 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:05:50.099 --> 00:06:04.679
And we have read it and why is it going to execute in terms of X is equal to why? This number 3 we can, we can put it here. The is equal to x D. Y y1 by 3 times. So we can just put it here.

61 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.859
Okay, why, when by 3 times the 1.

62 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:12.419
So, now we can put the value here straight away.

63 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.559
Is equal to 2, so we can put it here.

64 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:32.309
All right, this 1, and when you put here, and we put X is equal to y1 by 3 here the 2, we can take it out this common. We can write it over here and then we can just integrate it.

65 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:37.709
To get is equal to, for 10 this, this is equal to 0.4meters.

66 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:41.789
All right, so this is like 1 of the, uh.

67 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.799
Experts here for.

68 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.609
Um, it's a situation is, uh.

69 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:06:50.609 --> 00:07:00.209
The same, you can use the same strip if you want. We can same news. You know, what they have done is that we have, they have actually used the same strip.

70 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:13.409
Why is he going to execute? Can be this equation of the curve it can be written as executed by 1 by 3. why? As I explained the central distance from the center of the step to this is why.

71 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:23.399
It is not X by 2 as before, because expert to the center of the, the strip in the X direction is half the length of the strip right?

72 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.579
And the center in the right direction, it's just 1.

73 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.579
So, I is equal to why.

74 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:34.049
Similarly, we can find out why bar bar is equal to.

75 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:39.449
Particularly bad times da, da, we can put easily over here. Why is why.

76 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.859
So 1st, on the 2nd term again, we have the here.

77 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:43.859 --> 00:07:52.469
You can integrate it the limits of whether you take the stream we have taken it horizontal limits as, you know, to 1.

78 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:07:52.469 --> 00:08:01.379
But if you took this trip as vertical, if you had taken it, the limits would again be from 0 to 1. anyway we have our strip horizontal.

79 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:07.199
This is going to be 0 to 1 so integrating it you will get 0.571.

80 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:14.159
Okay, so that's our question number 1.

81 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:32.789
Question number 2 question number 2 we have to find out if you look, we have this parable again. The version of the line, the curve is given in terms of why why is equal to 1-104 times X Square.

82 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:40.229
Now, we can take, uh, let's say, in this case, what they have done is that they have taken a vertical strip.

83 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:46.859
But this is our vertical strips sorry for the very bad handwriting.

84 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:57.569
Okay, what you can strip the vertical height is equal to why the horizontal is like this distance is the, I'll just show it over here.

85 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:08:57.569 --> 00:09:01.259
So, vertical is the why herself in.

86 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:05.669
The limits of this trip is from minus to to cluster.

87 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:10.979
Right. It can move from this point, which is -2.

88 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:14.309
To this point, which is +2. Okay.

89 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:14.309 --> 00:09:19.829
Um, let us write down the center of the, the, the strip.

90 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:25.409
Um, I'm going to just use another marker.

91 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:30.899
Okay, so this is my right.

92 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:36.689
Okay, the center the center of the strip is some other way here.

93 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:41.369
Okay, you have to find that distance in the X bar and the whiteboard.

94 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:41.369 --> 00:09:48.479
Um, so as far as why bar is concerned, why bought the verticals centroid for this?

95 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:48.479 --> 00:09:53.729
So, height is this why? Right? So, the central will be equal to by by 2.

96 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:57.509
And horizontally, it is just equal to X.

97 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:00.659
Okay, so.

98 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:00.659 --> 00:10:08.909
We will put Y, times D x Y is already given. So why is equal to this value times?

99 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:13.379
We are going to put it in the formula for or.

100 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.949
So it is, uh.

101 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:20.609
Uh, times, why times the X.

102 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:24.419
And over, you know, D, this expression here.

103 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:44.419
So, now you have to integrate this integration is can be done from -2, too positive 2 as explained before. Now, what you can do over here is you can open these brackets. Okay. And try to simplify this expression. So, this might this term. And this will term you can just open them.

104 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:47.819
And you will hopefully get this expression of.

105 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:47.819 --> 00:10:55.769
We can keep in it, keep it out as a common and below also you can integrate the 1st term. Then you can integrate the 2nd term.

106 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:02.759
Up you can integrate the 1st term and the 2nd term and then the 3rd, 1, then you can apply the integration.

107 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:19.949
So, this figure is symmetrical over the Y axis. Right? So would be equal to 0 and the vertical bar it can be calculated from this procedure is equal to 0.4meters.

108 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:30.029
Now, we are going to look at centers of composite bodies. The previously, what we did was centralized by integration method.

109 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:41.009
So, for centroid of composed bodies, uh, the formulas that we use are very similar to the integration, except that instead of integration.

110 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:46.169
Okay, now we have finite shifts so we are just going to use some issues.

111 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:49.649
Okay, so tip 1, is that if.

112 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:54.869
Apart is symmetrical about the X axis. The center of the part lies on the access.

113 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:11:54.869 --> 00:12:07.499
On that X axis if the symmetrical axis is the Y, axis, the center of the part can with the Y axis. So if you have an access of symmetry, 1 of the centers is going to be lying over that cemetery.

114 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:07.499 --> 00:12:12.449
It depends which, which access if you have Y axis then x axis is.

115 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:12.449 --> 00:12:17.459
0, if the X axis is the symmetric, then it's the Y, axis. That is, you.

116 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:17.459 --> 00:12:24.929
Why is central to that? 0 tip 2 better to arrange everything in a tabular form?

117 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:35.429
So, in class, we did this L section so in this L section, we have the X Y, and we have the particularly the height is 4 meters horizontally. The height is 3 meters.

118 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:35.429 --> 00:12:43.079
So, we have point 5 as a thickness of this angle section. We have to look at the center of the cross sectional area.

119 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:43.079 --> 00:12:52.019
So, centroid X Y, and can be located with the help of this trigger. Now, you may be surprised and why is this, uh, centroid.

120 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:57.059
Lying outside of the other sections. Well, there are many shapes in which.

121 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:04.199
The centroid may not be inside the section. Normally that happens when you don't have.

122 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:09.929
Any access of symmetry you can have 1 axis of symmetry.

123 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:13.409
Okay, so let's say for the channel section.

124 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:13.409 --> 00:13:17.309
So, you can have 1 of the central.

125 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:24.059
This access and access of symmetry for the C section. So, 1 of the Central is rely on it. But then the other.

126 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:32.099
Central the device Android is 0, uh, it lies on the symmetric x axis, but the X.

127 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:39.959
Okay, the X file is going to have some value, and it may it may be outside of the channel section or the C section.

128 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:47.459
Okay, now, um, let us look at bar.

129 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:51.119
So, we are going to be putting each of these terms.

130 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.119
So times area.

131 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:13:54.119 --> 00:14:00.479
So, here, we have to angle to we have 1 angle section. We can divide it into.

132 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:05.099
You know, what we can do is that we can divide it into 2 shapes.

133 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:09.509
And let me color 1 of the shapes. So, 1 shape is this 1.

134 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:13.229
Oh, my God. I sorry.

135 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:21.299
This was very bad. Yeah.

136 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:26.189
So, this horizontal is 1 shape and the vertical 1 is the other share. Okay.

137 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:31.289
So, now what we can do here is, we can.

138 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:38.339
Uh, create a table with all the required parameters here. Uh, objective is to find out.

139 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:38.339 --> 00:14:51.629
Or, and, uh, we can locate the center of the original or the original, the small rectangles individual rectangles. So, X bar for the shape number 1.

140 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:54.659
Uh, my ship number 1 is this vertical 1?

141 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:57.929
Okay, so is.

142 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:04.589
We have mentioned with respect to this Y, axis and this access. Okay these are the different sexes.

143 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:08.669
So, X is 0.25vertically. This is.

144 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:13.229
0, uh, 2 meters. Okay, so point 2:5:and 2.

145 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:16.259
And horizontally, this part.

146 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:19.349
Right this remaining from here until here.

147 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:19.349 --> 00:15:22.409
This distance is actually.

148 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:25.919
To point, um.

149 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:29.849
You can subtract 3-0.5 so you have 2.5right.

150 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:36.869
So, I have a 2.5+this distance until here is equal to 1.75.

151 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:42.089
2.5so half of this is 1.251.2. 5.

152 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:46.379
0.5that is equal to 175.

153 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:46.379 --> 00:15:54.029
And what you can need the widest is 0.25okay half of this. So why bot is your point? 2 5.

154 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:15:54.029 --> 00:16:05.159
4 times 0.5is equal to 2. that is an area for this s*** the vertical check 4 times 0.5for the horizontal this rectangle multiply. 0.5.

155 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:05.159 --> 00:16:09.149
2.5times 0.5it is equal to 1.25.

156 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:13.649
Total area is coming out to be 3.25.

157 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:16.649
So really times a.

158 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:24.419
We can find out very easily. Extremely lot of times. 8. 0.25xby 2 is equal to 0.5.

159 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:24.419 --> 00:16:27.539
Then we are 1.75into 1.25.

160 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:32.429
That's basically 0.25times 2.

161 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:32.429 --> 00:16:35.819
And then 1.75times 1.5.

162 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:35.819 --> 00:16:39.809
Similarly, here we can write down 2 times 2.

163 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:43.469
And 0.25times 1.25.

164 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:47.909
So.

165 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:47.909 --> 00:16:52.589
Is equal to 2.6785now the 2nd 1.

166 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:56.489
Why 1 E1, that's why 2:8:2.

167 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:16:56.489 --> 00:17:00.479
Is equal to 4.3125right.

168 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:00.479 --> 00:17:11.369
So, we will put down this, this 1, the numerator, which we calculate it over here. And the denominator is 3.25the total area. You can find out. Excellent.

169 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:16.439
Similarly, so this 1.

170 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:25.349
4.3125is here and then 3.25that is the total area that is written here. You can find out.

171 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:31.379
Why.

172 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:39.449
All right, so now, let us move forward. We are going to be taking a look, at example, number 4.

173 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:49.079
Now, this is a T section, this, this section, um, we can divide it into you have to find out the central. Sorry? I forgot to mention that.

174 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:53.879
Locate the central X by Y, but we can divide it into 2 parts.

175 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:17:53.879 --> 00:18:00.299
Okay, so the 1st part, um, area, if you, if you.

176 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:00.299 --> 00:18:12.269
Look at this shape, the X axis is at the base and the Y axis is like in the middle here. Okay. So this why access the access of symmetry.

177 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:19.289
So, for both the rectangles as you can see the X Y, is equal to 0, which makes a lot of sense because.

178 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:24.299
Expired 0, because, uh, export is actually lying over this access, right?

179 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:27.569
So, now for this is area 1.

180 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:27.569 --> 00:18:31.319
Okay, and this is number 2.

181 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:40.619
So, for area 1, the centroid Y, bar is the total height is 300. so the centroid will be 300 divided by 2.

182 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:44.069
150, and for the other shapes.

183 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:44.069 --> 00:18:54.389
The rectangle horizontal rectangle uh, this height of this rectangle is at 50. so centroid would be in the middle. So 300.

184 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:18:54.389 --> 00:19:02.369
25, okay, 325. that is there area both the tangle is 300 by 50.

185 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:18.719
Uh, this is 300. this is 50. this was 300. this is 15. so, 15,000, this is, of course, going to be 0 x0 because expert actually, this is the central going to be. So, export is actually here.

186 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:19:18.719 --> 00:19:27.449
Why why we can find out using this formula so 15515945 times 15000.

187 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:30.839
The total is 7. 105,000.

188 "Sana Amir" (1471704832)
00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:36.839
Turns out to be 2007.5Million. So this would be the next example.

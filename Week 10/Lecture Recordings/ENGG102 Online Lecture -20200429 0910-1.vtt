00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:17.995
Good afternoon everyone today's topic is related to energy and work. So what is energy energy? The scale of quantity that is associated with the state or condition of one or more objects?

2
00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:31.824
Some characteristics of energy are that energy can be transformed from one type to another and transferred from one object to another how the total amount of energy remains the same.

3
00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.905
So you cannot create energy, you cannot destroy energy.

4
00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:42.685
And if she can only be transferred from one form to another only changes,

5
00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:46.524
it's for how I would energy me,

6
00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:48.895
have me undergo some losses,

7
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.884
which to us,

8
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:50.634
it feels like,

9
00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:50.875
you know,

10
00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:56.155
sometimes energy that you put in the system may not be the energy that you are taking out,

11
00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:03.414
but that is because you are losing some so you can do some energy in the form of some negative energy,

12
00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:04.045
for example,

13
00:01:04.045 --> 00:01:04.795
friction,

14
00:01:05.694 --> 00:01:06.204
you know,

15
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:07.644
any heat energy.

16
00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:10.644
If you have an object, you try to slide it on a surface.

17
00:01:11.064 --> 00:01:24.715
It's possible that when you apply the amount of force that you are applying, you're not able to and you're not able to convert that energy equally.

18
00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:32.034
So you are giving a lot of input, putting a lot of effort, but it is going you're not seeing the same output.

19
00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:40.704
The reason could be that maybe the surface has very high friction friction and a lot of energy is getting lost in trying to overcome that friction.

20
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:57.564
So, what is kinda, there are different types of energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, then heat, energy, thermal energy. So we will talk about most of these one by one.

21
00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:10.465
The first kind of energy that we will be discussing is kinetic energy. So kinetic energy is associated with the state of motion of an object the faster the object moves. The greater is a kinetic energy.

22
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:23.125
So, if you have an object or mass, and that the speed, as we, it is, that is well below the speed of light kinetic energy can be given by half MV square with Amazon, mass of the object.

23
00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:38.004
And we, we lost you object. So you wanna just kinda ticket energy and every other type of energy is Jude one Jude is equal to one kg meter square or second square in this equation. If I try to.

24
00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:51.655
Without a standard, soft, mass, standard units of mass kilograms. Actually, half is just a cost. So can this. And what is velocity velocity is meter per second.

25
00:02:53.004 --> 00:03:03.564
There's a square on it, so, with the units, become KGB, the square or second Square, which is which one what is work.

26
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:18.324
Work is the energy transferred to, or from an object by means of a force acting on the object, so to do some work, you need to apply a force on an object. Okay.

27
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:32.159
And that object must a certain distance if you apply force. And that object is not moving a certain certain distance according to physics you have not done anymore at all. Okay.

28
00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:41.455
So, work is energy transferred to, or from an object of force acting on an object. Energy transfer to the object is positive.

29
00:03:41.455 --> 00:03:50.514
Work energy transferred from the object is negative to something you give energy and sometimes you take energy, it can be negative and positive.

30
00:03:52.469 --> 00:04:05.514
If you want to calculate the work done by force so what we can do is we can take an object of a beat. Sorry we can take eight here. Okay. And let's say we apply a force on it.

31
00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:18.384
When we applied this force at at some angle, this beet, it is lying on this horizontal surface.

32
00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:33.595
So, it's so wide, so you have a B, you have a Y, there's a beat around it and you are applying a force what happens is that this speed is going to move along this way right? So, the direction of the displacement is horizontal.

33
00:04:36.925 --> 00:04:51.654
It is no displacement in the vertical direction. Yes. A displacement is what is on. The beat is only moving horizontal. So if you want to calculate the work done, it will be equal to the force.

34
00:04:53.425 --> 00:05:01.975
The displacement multiply by the and which which component of the force. If you look at this force here.

35
00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:17.814
It is four times distance or displacement that's the formula for the work done. So, when we want to find out, so we can see that this force has two components. One is the vertical one other one horizontal.

36
00:05:17.814 --> 00:05:24.865
So, the horizontal is the cost component here in this example. So.

37
00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:40.314
The work done is only done in the direction of the displacement. So, here, we just we have displacement only in the horizontal direction. So that means only the horizontal component of the force is doing any work.

38
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:50.095
What typical component of the force is not doing any work at all. I'll explain it to you and another way. So, let's say you have this access.

39
00:05:51.745 --> 00:06:00.355
This is an X axis and this isn't why access? And let's say your objectives here it does that though, if you apply a force f.

40
00:06:04.074 --> 00:06:14.964
And the object moves only in the. Yeah, so this is data. So, only the cost detail is doing some work. Only this one is doing somewhere.

41
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:28.074
Similarly, if you, if the object is moving in the direction of the displacement happens, particularly then only though what tickle component, which is assigned component, that is doing any work.

42
00:06:29.725 --> 00:06:39.384
The only time that components will do any work is that when this object, it moves at a distance. I mean, at some angle.

43
00:06:40.884 --> 00:06:41.064
Okay,

44
00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:45.235
whether it moves in the direction of the force or any other angle,

45
00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:46.285
as long as it is,

46
00:06:46.314 --> 00:06:47.394
any other angle,

47
00:06:47.904 --> 00:06:54.264
what components will do some work if it is moving along the components direction,

48
00:06:54.324 --> 00:06:58.314
the displacement is always along the component direction that it is not doing anyone.

49
00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:04.225
The only work being done is the force component in that direction.

50
00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:11.935
Okay, so going forward.

51
00:07:13.555 --> 00:07:22.795
In this example, if I want to calculate the work done, how can I calculate the work done worked on is equal to here. We have.

52
00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:38.334
Say work done that's the formula that is equal to four times the distance. Basically the project both of them force and distance. They are. Displacements.

53
00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:53.545
Sorry they went to quantities forces is that vector quantity work done is the product. So, when you take that product off to vector quantities, you will always get a scalar between work done is a scalar quantity it's expressed in jewels.

54
00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:06.714
Okay. And it has nothing to do with direction. Direct work does not have a direction, but force has a direction. This placement has a direction f. g that work done. So, what does the four now?

55
00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:17.964
If he, if he saw this equation, this will be key. This will be empty. Fine. F.

56
00:08:18.144 --> 00:08:31.045
D, cause of why cause of five the case, the displacement is only in the X direction. So it's only the force forces X component only this one. That is important. Here.

57
00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.634
There is no motion and that is inclined onward to.

58
00:08:35.904 --> 00:08:36.174
So,

59
00:08:36.174 --> 00:08:51.115
what typical component of the force of data it's not doing any work when forces act on an

60
00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:51.715
object.

61
00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:56.904
The network done on the object, the, some of the works done by the individual forces.

62
00:08:58.855 --> 00:09:12.629
Alright, so what it means is that if I have now, if I take the same example, I take x axis. I take Y axis. Okay.

63
00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:23.575
And now we are going to apply to forces, let's say, apply one force f one. Okay. And then we apply another force.

64
00:09:24.835 --> 00:09:35.904
So what's his of work done the work done will be some of the work done by the to forces so there are two ways of doing it one way is that you find out resultant of these two forces let's say,

65
00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:37.585
result of these two forces is,

66
00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:39.024
you know,

67
00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:44.245
the direction of the resultant let's say the displacement is in this direction.

68
00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:58.404
So, the work done is our cause of times the displacement in the okay otherwise you can also calculate it like this f, one, cause of the times D.

69
00:09:58.434 --> 00:10:06.924
plus f, two, cause of, you know, five, whatever let's say angle is fine. So f, to cause of five times, the displacement.

70
00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:16.524
Either you find out result of the forces and then calculate to work audio calculate, work, done by force one last work done by.

71
00:10:19.705 --> 00:10:28.315
Oh, I work in kinetic energy related. Yeah. Change in the kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the work done.

72
00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:35.664
What it means is that let's say if an object is moving, which some initial velocity. Okay.

73
00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:45.144
And it keeps moving at that velocity. There is no work done. You didn't do anyone.

74
00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:54.445
However, if the object is moving at some initial velocity and you made it faster, you apply to force you increase the speed even more.

75
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:03.054
Than you did somewhere, or you apply the force of the opposite direction and stopped the final velocity is zero.

76
00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:18.894
So, every time there is a change in the velocity of an object do to the application of a force, only then you have done some work. If an object is at rest, it's velocity zero and it keeps on just lying there.

77
00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:29.725
No work is done on it, but if it is addressed and you'll give it to push, it starts moving, it has a final velocity. So it's velocity. There was a change in the velocity from zero to some value.

78
00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:40.315
Now, you have some work done similarly if and object is moving at, let's say, thirty minutes a second you give it a push and it starts moving at a forty meter per second.

79
00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:46.644
So the change from ten to forty is basically your network.

80
00:11:47.424 --> 00:11:56.485
So, there must be a change in the velocity chain and the kinetic energy of the system to say that there is some work be done.

81
00:11:59.514 --> 00:12:06.414
If the network done on the particle is positive and the particle kinetic energy increases by the amount of work.

82
00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:19.735
And the converse is also, when you have positive kinetic energy, then the work done is, let's say, if if the change in the kinetic energy is positive, initially it was thirty. Finally, it is forty.

83
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:33.894
So, there's a positive increase we worked on is positive, but let's say, initially is forty and then finally it is twenty or ten or zero. So, that means this is the work done is negative. Do you have any questions and to now.

84
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:51.924
Here about other students I heard from to.

85
00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:08.455
So, going forward, I'm going to do a sample problem. So here.

86
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:27.924
Look at this problem so there are two industrial space sliding at initially stage three, two hundred and twenty five kilogram for safe. A displacement of magnitude eight point.

87
00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:30.414
Five meters straight towards the truck.

88
00:13:32.065 --> 00:13:41.004
I've taken this from a book where they have given waiting interesting examples, like narrative based so they are to industrial spies.

89
00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:47.664
So they are data there are some spice, you know, how it different industries are, like, in competition with each other.

90
00:13:47.664 --> 00:14:02.125
So, they're always trying to cheat, steal each other's, not always, I mean, it's unethical, but sometimes they do the things that they try to steal their secret trade secrets or you might hear something is happening.

91
00:14:03.059 --> 00:14:14.754
So, anyway, there, so to industrial spice, they're trying to slide and initially say, initially stationary, two hundred and twenty five kilogram save displacement. D of magnitude eight point five meters.

92
00:14:15.445 --> 00:14:24.264
This is by one and this is by to. So they are displacing in this direction. And a displacement is eight point five minutes.

93
00:14:26.004 --> 00:14:36.325
So, they are going straight towards their truck. The push f, one on the spy is twelve push f, one off spy one is twelve newtons.

94
00:14:36.565 --> 00:14:46.945
So f, one, this guy is applying force in this direction and it is equal to twelve niches. It's at an angle of thirty degrees. Yes. So this is given.

95
00:14:49.404 --> 00:14:55.554
The second guy, he is applying a force of f two. That is equal. Ten Newton.

96
00:14:56.634 --> 00:14:59.514
And he's applying at forty degrees, right?

97
00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:09.955
Above the horizontal the of these forces do not change as a safe and the floor and see if they make fiction list contexts.

98
00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:24.024
So the floor and save, they are basically frictionless and these two f one and f two. They are not they are not changing the flow restriction as that means there is no force of friction.

99
00:15:24.475 --> 00:15:37.105
So this is why in the diagram here you don't see any force. What are the forces must be exerted where you will have, of course, a normal reaction exerted by the floor on the object in the vertical direction.

100
00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:40.164
And then the weight of the object will be acting downward.

101
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:56.424
What you have to do, what is a network done on the safe by forces f, one and f during the displacement you have to calculate the network done.

102
00:15:57.325 --> 00:16:04.735
Save it's moving in the horizontal direction so basically the work done is in the horizontal. Right?

103
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:13.315
So you will consider only those forces that are doing the work, or that have a component in the horizontal direction.

104
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:24.355
That means when a body see, when a body is moving in the horizontal direction, any four that you apply at the top, that's not going to do anything.

105
00:16:25.674 --> 00:16:28.254
It's not helping, it's not though it's not doing any work.

106
00:16:30.059 --> 00:16:44.875
So, the network done, we can calculate the work done by force one, and then we can get work done by force to and then be simply add them together. So work done by the first one will be one cause of Peter. Yes.

107
00:16:44.875 --> 00:16:46.075
So, twelve mutants.

108
00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:53.215
Yeah, that just a magnitude it's placements and D, and angle is causal.

109
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.335
So this is basically the work done by the first force, the second forces f, two.

110
00:17:04.615 --> 00:17:18.565
Causes so forces then Newton displacements eight point five and the horizontal component, the forces acting at forty degrees. So that displacement is in this direction.

111
00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:32.904
So, the horizontal component is cause of forty. So second work done. This this, what is the total work done? Total work done will be hundred day. Three. That's the total work done.

112
00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:53.964
So, during the displacement, what does a work done on the safe by the gravitational force? F. G. and what is the work done on the save by the normal force? F.

113
00:17:54.295 --> 00:18:07.194
F. N. from the doing this displacement now they're asking that. What's the work done by the wait and by the normally, right?

114
00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:09.924
Oh.

115
00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:18.835
Displacement isn't this direction? It is acting downwards the normal forces acting upwards.

116
00:18:20.339 --> 00:18:30.174
So, what does cause of these angles? These angles are ninety degrees of ninety zero so we can mathematically improve it.

117
00:18:31.674 --> 00:18:43.734
The angle between fourth and the displacement is ninety. You can also, by the way, I don't know if, you know, or not, but the dot one of two forces, that's the rule vector.

118
00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:48.204
A, when you take a product with a, let's say, B.

119
00:18:49.734 --> 00:19:01.825
This is equal to a B, let's say this is Victor a, and let's say this is what this angle is data.

120
00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:07.404
So, their product is a because of yeah.

121
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.484
So, we will apply this force times distance, cause of data.

122
00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:24.474
So, what's the force? The weight is mg displacements at the cause of cause of ninety zero similarly or normal reaction.

123
00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:31.255
Do you still work done by the normal normal force and the weight?

124
00:19:31.285 --> 00:19:40.795
Because they are in the vertical direction and the space, and also the angle but angle is ninety between the force and the displacement was of ninety's.

125
00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:50.964
What's the safest initially stationary? So that means initial velocity is equal to zero. I can write it like this initial velocity is equal to.

126
00:19:52.049 --> 00:20:04.075
What does the initial kinetic energy? Initial kinetic energy is half empty. I square it. Is you asking? What is a final speed?

127
00:20:04.075 --> 00:20:11.815
We, at the end of eight point five meters displacement. So they're, they want to ask us the final velocity.

128
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.365
You know, that the final kinetic energy that is given by.

129
00:20:18.954 --> 00:20:21.414
Off M VF.

130
00:20:24.299 --> 00:20:28.615
What did we say before? What's the work done? Work done by definition is.

131
00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:32.904
Work is equal to change in the kind of technology.

132
00:20:34.795 --> 00:20:38.634
Any changes the kinetic energy so final kinetic energy.

133
00:20:41.069 --> 00:20:43.884
Minus and he should kinetic energy.

134
00:20:45.295 --> 00:20:59.755
Is equal to the work done you already calculated the total work done before total work done is hundred and fifty three point four so here's this equation hundred and fifty three fifty three point. Four.

135
00:21:01.224 --> 00:21:14.305
Okay. Initial velocity is equal to zero. So, mass is given for the saved twenty five kilograms, so you can find out the final velocity. Yeah. Find every loss is equal to one point. One.

136
00:21:14.305 --> 00:21:20.424
Seven second is clear. Any questions.

137
00:21:30.714 --> 00:21:41.724
Oh, okay, okay. The next is work done by gravitational force gravity to any work.

138
00:21:42.684 --> 00:21:47.424
Data case yes, if you have an object here.

139
00:21:52.079 --> 00:22:04.255
Apply a force in the vertical direction. So I imagine I have an object. This is my phone. It's on the desk. I can't see what where is the camera you can see me.

140
00:22:11.964 --> 00:22:12.204
So.

141
00:22:15.684 --> 00:22:18.894
So, hey, just, you know, the object it's placed here.

142
00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:22.345
I have to play a force in the vertical.

143
00:22:24.234 --> 00:22:27.325
And I lift it. Okay.

144
00:22:27.865 --> 00:22:39.325
So, this force that I'm going is doing some positive work, it is force the manager of the, let's say I'm applying to new to well, that's anyway.

145
00:22:40.134 --> 00:22:52.525
I'm just taking a random number so I'm applying some force. So to Newton's and the forced direction. What's the work done by this? For the work done by this for the applied force will be.

146
00:22:58.914 --> 00:23:08.035
Dot D, so if we take this, what if we take a this asset action on the displacement?

147
00:23:08.394 --> 00:23:18.474
And we say that, you know, it is towards a positive Y, axis Legends, you positive Y, axis here. So, what's the angle between the fourth and the displacement.

148
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:32.724
What's the angle between force on the displacement displacement? If the force of the vertical direction upwards displacement is in the vertical action upwards and Y, axis. We're taking positive Y upwards.

149
00:23:33.115 --> 00:23:40.045
So what's the angle between the fourth displacement? Zero? Yes, thank you. So, dancer will be worked on will be empty.

150
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:50.305
Cause of data ties, you know, so the work done is empty cause of today's one. Okay so work done is forced time distance.

151
00:23:51.984 --> 00:24:02.184
This fourth is doing positive work. Why? Because the direction of the force and the other displacement, they are the same. So, this is positive work done.

152
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.785
What does gravity doing? Basically get anyone telling me.

153
00:24:08.339 --> 00:24:22.134
Forces applied forces upwards. It is displacing upwards that original gravity's downwards. So gravity's actually opposing the work done. Right? So the work done by gravity.

154
00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:36.055
The difference will be picked up is now hundred and eighteen as far as gravity's concerned. Yes, it is resisting. Gravity is here. So between gravity and displacement, this angle is hundred and eighty causal.

155
00:24:36.355 --> 00:24:40.315
Eighty is minus one. So, what's the work done? Minus.

156
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:52.615
Or so gravity or the wait multiplied by them. Displacement. Yeah. So this is the negative work force is doing positive work. Gravity is doing negative on the object.

157
00:24:54.569 --> 00:24:56.545
Some other examples of the work done.

158
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:09.805
Work done by a spring force, so let's just say, yeah. Look at this figure. So we have a spring. Okay. It is attached to some figure.

159
00:25:11.184 --> 00:25:16.194
Sorry, some, some support, so here is the string attached to this.

160
00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:26.214
And this is the initial position. Oh, figured that is the note could be is the initial one. Yeah.

161
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:41.694
This is initial zero end, or the spring load is being applied and then you apply the force. Is that one for sure? So what will happen the spring will stretch in the positive direction.

162
00:25:43.704 --> 00:25:43.884
Now,

163
00:25:43.884 --> 00:25:46.015
when you apply a spring force,

164
00:25:46.434 --> 00:25:47.845
stretch spring,

165
00:25:48.325 --> 00:25:59.095
what will happen inside the spring spring is going to exert the storing force that will be in the opposite direction to the displacement.

166
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:08.934
What is the city storing? Force? See, the spring has a certain stiffness. It has certain stiffness.

167
00:26:09.204 --> 00:26:23.904
When you apply a force on the spring, this stiffness tries to assist that force. Okay. So the, the twenty four is related to that stiffness. It's the, it's the opposite force.

168
00:26:24.085 --> 00:26:35.095
So the restoring force is always opposite to the direction of that displacement, that is why you always have a negative sign because FS and X are opposite in that.

169
00:26:35.849 --> 00:26:44.244
Yeah so the applied forces f, it displaces in positive x axis direction. Fs isn't restoring forces in that negative direction.

170
00:26:45.684 --> 00:26:49.255
So the formula is FX is equal to minus effects.

171
00:26:50.130 --> 00:27:00.325
Yeah, that can be that this is zero and then instead of stretching it, we apply a force in this direction. So I'm, I'm going to apply a force here.

172
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:11.904
Compress it so now negative it does it was a negative XX, it's spring is shortening. It is. Displacement is negative.

173
00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:22.045
The data shows that he's toning force well, the job of the stiffness, it's to oppose whatever motion, you are producing positive or negative.

174
00:27:22.734 --> 00:27:31.644
So now that restoring force will be opposite to the direction of the applied force. So, when you apply a force of the spring, and you try to resistant.

175
00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:46.224
Because here again, the access negative, the negative sign is there f, and X are always opposite to each other. That's what the negative science shows.

176
00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:51.954
This is, what is the negative sign?

177
00:27:52.585 --> 00:28:06.144
Just shows this, that your force, and the displacement add in the opposite direction the restoring force and the displacement in the opposite direction is always minus X in general.

178
00:28:06.144 --> 00:28:19.255
You can say force spring force is equal to K, times X many in many literature. You will not see this negative sign. The reason is that is understood that restoring force is always opposite to that displacement.

179
00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:32.664
Just like, just forces compression force is not actually written as negative report a negative sign to help us differentiate from attention folks when we're doing problems.

180
00:28:33.924 --> 00:28:41.904
Otherwise forces compressive, depression shows that it is opposite. So, similarly, yeah, the forces restoring.

181
00:28:50.335 --> 00:28:53.904
So the forces storing, that is why it is negative.

182
00:28:57.684 --> 00:29:02.785
I want to ask you, have you received any email regarding the exam guidelines?

183
00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:06.115
What to expect in the exam?

184
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.204
Have you received any exam guidelines from the university? They told me yeah.

185
00:29:17.724 --> 00:29:28.795
So, we're going to do the exam the yeah. Okay. So we are going to do the exam the same way as we did the, the midterm exam. It will be two hours long. However, not four hours.

186
00:29:29.394 --> 00:29:34.255
So, it will be two hours long, and I will give you forty five minutes extra to scan and.

187
00:29:36.414 --> 00:29:43.285
And you will upload as PDF however, you have to put your and this is compulsory that you have to put your.

188
00:29:45.355 --> 00:29:53.454
Camera away and both audio and video have to be open. So I, we will, we will discuss more when I see for students.

189
00:29:57.115 --> 00:30:10.855
So I will also I will also post final exam guidelines on so that, you know, that's how we are going to conduct exam.

190
00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:17.664
Okay, we'll work.

191
00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:27.355
Your audio is open, your video is open, your Mike will be open.

192
00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:34.704
I I think if everyone is working in, it shouldn't be a big problem.

193
00:30:39.295 --> 00:30:50.575
And especially opening video has nothing to do with how you solve some audio. Maybe you can say that what, if someone is loud but, I mean, you will be putting it away.

194
00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:18.744
We'll see how it goes. I don't expect any problems see how it goes.

195
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:33.684
When we are having exams, not, everyone is going to see what happens is that when we are having class, maybe other people are also are also having classes, but exams are according to the time table.

196
00:31:34.224 --> 00:31:44.424
Not everyone is going to have the exam and not. Everyone is having online, so there will be less fluid on WebEx. We'll see how it goes.

197
00:31:45.805 --> 00:31:54.835
So, we can do it this way that your audio right now my audio is open right? But everyone else's audio is I mean, your Mike's on off.

198
00:31:56.815 --> 00:32:11.214
And your videos also off, but on just on that today for two hours, hour and forty five minutes, or do you have to be open? This is for quality assurance and these are the, this is what we have to do.

199
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:19.555
Okay, so so, let's calculate the work done by this three storing force.

200
00:32:19.585 --> 00:32:28.585
What kind of work is done so when you move the string from an initial point, initial distance X, this is initial position. X.

201
00:32:29.244 --> 00:32:41.724
and final position is X f, you know, whether it is positive, or maybe it is negative your final depends on which direction you are moving. So W, of s will be equal to four times displacement.

202
00:32:41.724 --> 00:32:45.059
So minus f, X times the effects. Okay.

203
00:32:45.384 --> 00:32:57.595
And you integrate between X, two X, initial position to find a position why minus FX case as we said, that restoring force is always opposite to the direction of that displacement.

204
00:32:58.105 --> 00:33:06.565
This is basically your displacement and this is basically on force. Actually. Sorry. Yeah.

205
00:33:07.704 --> 00:33:22.134
This is basically a force and this also, I think it's in this way in, like, integrating it helps, because this you can have a variable for snow. Okay. Maybe you are applying a force. But that force is not a constant.

206
00:33:22.589 --> 00:33:36.505
So, in that case, you can't just use for Stein's distance and you use the formula force dot distance or the displacement that means the force is constant, but right. Having a function of eFax that means, Equifax can be variable.

207
00:33:36.505 --> 00:33:37.914
So, basically it takes care of.

208
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:52.734
The fact that not many times when you apply a force and object, you can maintain it, unless it isn't automated force. You can maintain it hundred percent by that amount. Yeah. So that's why they you have an integration. Okay. So, f, affects the X.

209
00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:55.434
you know, that what is FX.

210
00:33:56.904 --> 00:33:59.394
Equifax is the the sorry.

211
00:34:01.464 --> 00:34:15.655
I'm sorry this, this effects is basically or the displacement you are integrating, you are moving from to X that says why you are integrating for this small Intel off the displacement.

212
00:34:16.405 --> 00:34:29.934
Now what does FX FX is minus scale effects. Okay. So, this minus sign is already there into the of X minus K is a constant so X of X within the values.

213
00:34:31.885 --> 00:34:45.894
So you get this, so this is a work done by a string of K X squared, minus half gate access, notice that it is different from the change in the kinetic energy for the kinetic energy.

214
00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:49.135
It was half empty Square.

215
00:34:50.130 --> 00:35:00.175
Minus half ice squid, so, and I was later, but in the spring I is first f is late.

216
00:35:01.284 --> 00:35:07.405
The reason is that this is a negative sign and so because because of this negative sign,

217
00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:10.284
this is switched you will have a,

218
00:35:10.284 --> 00:35:10.704
if I,

219
00:35:10.704 --> 00:35:11.335
for example,

220
00:35:11.364 --> 00:35:12.625
with a negative sign here,

221
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.934
the final velocity becomes,

222
00:35:14.965 --> 00:35:16.434
this expression becomes negative.

223
00:35:16.434 --> 00:35:18.114
And this expression becomes positive.

224
00:35:19.644 --> 00:35:28.045
It's, it's reverse spring. So what is the work done by kinetic energy?

225
00:35:28.074 --> 00:35:38.184
That is the change in the kinetic energy is the work done when our objectives in motion to change the kind of ticket. And if there is a chain of kinetic energy, sound work is done.

226
00:35:39.204 --> 00:35:48.864
In case of spring when a spring moves from an initial position to to some final position X, there will be worked on by the East voting force.

227
00:35:50.820 --> 00:36:05.215
That's the work done by a spring force, or the spring restoring force. So, let us do an example in the figure acumen canister of mass M is equal to four point. Five zero point.

228
00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:12.505
Four kilogram slider across the horizontal frictionless counter with speed is equal to zero point. Five meter per second.

229
00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:20.574
It then runs into encompass is a spring of spring constant is equal to seven fifty.

230
00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:33.864
When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring by what this is a spring compressed. So you have a spring here. This is this initial position.

231
00:36:37.465 --> 00:36:46.135
Now, you have a canister of mass and okay it is sliding across the surface with the velocity. That's initial velocity.

232
00:36:47.244 --> 00:36:58.735
And should velocity zero point five it is moving. So then it strikes the spring surface. So actually, what will happen the spring with compressed spring comes here.

233
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:12.324
So, what does the displacement displacement will be okay the spring has a constant case now when this scan, it's, it's it strikes the spring.

234
00:37:12.684 --> 00:37:25.434
Each momentarily comes to stop. So, that means the final velocity is equal to zero. I find a lost zero because it's a stationary. Now, what's the question?

235
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:40.045
The question is why what this to see is the spring compressed we have to find out the distance date by which the spring is compressed now in problems like these. You have to look at it in this way.

236
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:57.324
Some work is being done here that would work, or the energy that is stored in the in the mass in the object, and again stuff when it is moving with a certain velocity.

237
00:37:58.255 --> 00:38:10.974
Same the same energy. It is going to transfer to the spring, right? If I have certain energy, same energy, I'm going to transfer whatever it is. My energy should be. If there is a contact happening.

238
00:38:12.175 --> 00:38:25.074
Yeah, so I have set an energy or I have certain knowledge. Okay and we meet in lecture and then I transfer it to you. So whatever I know and this is not technically true.

239
00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:41.155
Because you are students you will not always learn hundred percent. Okay, you will learn hundred percent when you you do need to do some extra effort, like, you know, practice and everything. I give a wrong example. Ideally whatever I ninety five.

240
00:38:41.724 --> 00:38:50.394
Yes. So whichever I'm transferring to you. You will gain it from me. You will gain it from the same as a thing.

241
00:38:50.730 --> 00:39:02.485
So, every time you have problems like these, you will dry down work done by the canister should be equal to the work done on the screen. There should be equal.

242
00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:16.494
Equation energy is concerned, so when the spring is moving at a certain velocity, and it comes to a stop, so its velocity changes that is kinetic energy changes that means some energy is stored in it.

243
00:39:17.724 --> 00:39:32.244
Right, and some work is done. And how much is the spring work when the spring gets compressed so it also does some work storing force does it does some work how much will that work?

244
00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:43.525
Well, that energy that will be equal to whatever it's input input is equal to output. So we can write an equation work done.

245
00:39:45.534 --> 00:39:48.594
By the spring is equal to the work done by.

246
00:39:50.514 --> 00:39:59.875
By the kinetic energy, so we can write it like this change and the kinetic energy that is the work done, right? So this work done should be equal to.

247
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:16.974
You know, the work done by the spring should be well, that is right write it down further. What does the kinetic energy work done? The final kinetic energy minus the initial current that is a change in the kinetic energy.

248
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:28.019
That is a work done. So, this change the kinetic energy. This is also equal to half empty square minus.

249
00:40:28.014 --> 00:40:40.675
Hoff MV squared is equal to you just started. Previously this equation worked on for the spring half K X.

250
00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:43.014
I square minus half K except squid.

251
00:40:44.934 --> 00:40:51.324
Show off.

252
00:40:52.170 --> 00:41:01.224
K. X. I square minus half key X. F squid.

253
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:08.635
This one, I'm just inputting this one.

254
00:41:09.864 --> 00:41:20.880
Now, what does de de is a difference between X and X f, right? It is a distance it or it is the difference between the two. Okay.

255
00:41:21.324 --> 00:41:33.474
So we can say that X if you say that X is zero. That's our zero point. Reference point, we can give it some alternate. So let's say this part is zero.

256
00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:39.355
This point is zero and what does this point coordinates of this point this point is the.

257
00:41:40.675 --> 00:41:51.085
Zero today, so then is equal to zero similarly final velocity because the canister, when it strikes the spring, it is zero.

258
00:41:52.585 --> 00:42:05.994
So, we are left with this half. mbi Square is equal to half cake size Square. Basically, this equation when they have written this equation, they have sort of missed couple of steps directly.

259
00:42:05.994 --> 00:42:20.784
They have written change the kinetic energy is a work done by the so minus half Katy Square. Yeah, but remember that D is from to accept if the initial position is zero the final position is heavy, right?

260
00:42:20.875 --> 00:42:21.594
It's like this.

261
00:42:22.945 --> 00:42:36.474
And solving it, you can find out the distances equal to one point two centimeters. So that's a work done by the spring. An example of that.

262
00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:46.974
Previously we said that many times, the fourth is not going to be constant. Okay meaning that force can be a function of time is the function of facts.

263
00:42:47.849 --> 00:42:54.804
So let's say we're applying a force, so this is the force. Okay. So.

264
00:42:55.949 --> 00:43:09.835
Apply a force, it is not a constant force, and you want to find out the work done, so normally work done. The formula is four times. Distance is equal to work done this, which is basically under the car.

265
00:43:10.344 --> 00:43:22.704
If I just, let's say if the force is constant, this is a force. This is X. okay you are applying a constant force, and you are moving in object from the initial position to the final position.

266
00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:32.184
So, what does a work done for time? Distance? Right? Forced time distance. So, that is the end of the code forced time distance.

267
00:43:33.385 --> 00:43:39.835
But what if the this, this is not a constant rather it is it's some function. Okay.

268
00:43:40.195 --> 00:43:53.875
So, in that case, you can integrate, you can divide this trip, you know, you can divide it with the strip over here and then you integrated between these two limits FX time. Do you enforced times distance?

269
00:43:55.045 --> 00:44:01.644
But that is work done via radio force and moving the object from is some initial position to.

270
00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:11.125
So this is expression, we can also write in different ways.

271
00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:24.235
Okay you can also make some substitutions and I don't because f, what is f force the net force is equal to mass times acceleration. What is the acceleration?

272
00:44:24.235 --> 00:44:30.204
Acceleration is velocity over time, right? And what is velocity.

273
00:44:33.059 --> 00:44:46.974
Philosophies yeah, so you can make some substitutions work done is also equal to mass times, acceleration time DX, or it is equal to this kinetic energy also.

274
00:44:50.489 --> 00:45:03.505
So we can, you can write down the work done expression in different ways. Fx DX works m a Times D, access the same thing or the difference of the kinetic energy. And of course, the formula of the kinetic energy has velocity.

275
00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:07.945
So this is a work done by a variable force. What if.

276
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:21.474
The force is having I. J. K. components. Okay. And the displacement is also vector having key components. Previously. We took an example.

277
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.605
That if this is your mass, you apply a force.

278
00:45:27.954 --> 00:45:40.375
This is angle data. So what does this for Spector? Basically, this force factor is FX plus f. Y. J. F cause of data.

279
00:45:42.715 --> 00:45:55.105
Less f. Y is f, sign off so we are applying this force. Now he said that if the displacement is only horizontal. So that means only this component is doing work.

280
00:45:56.125 --> 00:46:02.335
Or, if the displacement is only what to go, that means only this component is doing some word right?

281
00:46:03.869 --> 00:46:17.905
What, if displacement is not just in the X or Y, direction, what is? Displacement is also a vector. Displacement is meaning it's at some angle.

282
00:46:19.014 --> 00:46:21.355
So, let's say that displacement is in this direction.

283
00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:35.094
This is fine, or is in this direction, or maybe the same direction as a force many possibilities. So, that means when you write down towards this is a work done formula.

284
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.545
So what does in this case,

285
00:46:38.545 --> 00:46:50.005
when a displacement is also having some components so then you will right the four specter dot the director,

286
00:46:50.394 --> 00:46:52.585
and so in generally speaking,

287
00:46:52.585 --> 00:46:54.505
let's say you have a three D force,

288
00:46:55.105 --> 00:46:56.784
and this space is also three D,

289
00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:00.539
what will be the work done force,

290
00:47:00.534 --> 00:47:00.804
time,

291
00:47:00.804 --> 00:47:01.465
displacement,

292
00:47:02.635 --> 00:47:03.235
FX,

293
00:47:03.235 --> 00:47:03.445
D,

294
00:47:03.445 --> 00:47:03.864
ex,

295
00:47:04.284 --> 00:47:06.324
next component and X displacement,

296
00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:07.045
plus the Y,

297
00:47:07.045 --> 00:47:07.585
component,

298
00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:07.974
and the Y,

299
00:47:07.974 --> 00:47:08.485
displacement,

300
00:47:08.485 --> 00:47:11.394
plus the Z component and displacement.

301
00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:28.284
Finally, if the forces are very able, I mean, this is this is a differential work. So, if you want to find out the total work done, you can integrate like, this, giving the limits for WI.

302
00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:32.454
Fi to why for it will be to see.

303
00:47:41.815 --> 00:47:48.954
Any questions any questions to know.

304
00:47:54.690 --> 00:48:05.514
All good. Okay, so today's lecture is until two thirty that's the lecture scheduled for today.

305
00:48:07.644 --> 00:48:19.554
And then from two, thirty to three, thirty, we're going to be talking, we're going to be doing some problems. Okay. I will not to ask you that you have to stay here.

306
00:48:20.454 --> 00:48:26.364
In any case, I will be recording the lecture and I am going to be uploading it so it will be the same.

307
00:48:28.764 --> 00:48:35.335
You know, the same recording, or maybe I will stop it and record again for problems related to central voice and movement.

308
00:48:37.889 --> 00:48:42.594
We need more practice on that topic. So, next topic is.

309
00:48:46.914 --> 00:48:52.344
No, it's yeah, it says hundred. Let me just correct it.

310
00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:57.505
Actually, by default, it is always hundred assignments and everything.

311
00:49:00.269 --> 00:49:12.144
So, it's a full is anyone getting with marks that means it just out of ten? Let me connect now.

312
00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:15.054
Place I forget.

313
00:49:41.635 --> 00:49:43.795
Never mind. I'm going to.

314
00:49:46.074 --> 00:49:52.014
When I put it on on, I will correct it. Yeah. Now, icon corrected it's.

315
00:49:55.199 --> 00:50:09.684
So don't worry about it. Yeah, so anyone, who's one of you has nine, nine? So it's nine out of ten. Sorry? Not nine out to one hundred and someone has ten out of ten.

316
00:50:09.684 --> 00:50:23.005
So you have it's not ten out to one hundred. It's ten out of ten, so the time rate at which the work is done by a force is set to be the power due to the force. If a force doesn't amount of work.

317
00:50:23.065 --> 00:50:27.744
W, so the work done. So, we, we've talked about the work done. Okay.

318
00:50:27.744 --> 00:50:42.625
Now, if you are mentioning, that work done in a certain amount of time, like, you make time factor, also that okay, this much work is done, but in how much time has done, that gives you the power, right?

319
00:50:42.655 --> 00:50:57.235
Otherwise see, I give you an assignment. Okay. One person does it in one day. Other person does it in one month. Do you think it's fair to judge them as being equal?

320
00:51:00.414 --> 00:51:04.764
Okay, because one person finished in one day the other person finished.

321
00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:20.425
In one month or the same amount to work. So, time does matter. Right? Well, done in one day is not. The same as work done in a month work done in a month. It's very less work on average. It has less power.

322
00:51:20.425 --> 00:51:29.485
It has less meaning. Someone who is was very efficient. He's doing all that work in, you know, in one day that means it's.

323
00:51:31.074 --> 00:51:43.914
I give you these silly examples, because I think they kind of I I think you will understand it better this way if I give you these every day examples. So please bear with me when I'm talking like this.

324
00:51:44.784 --> 00:51:52.704
So well done, when you define it within a certain amount of time, that means is the problem.

325
00:51:55.105 --> 00:52:09.114
So in general, when you calculate the work done over a certain period of time from T, one to T two, it's the average power. So we are looking at an average, maybe let's say you are doing the work done in twenty four hours. Okay.

326
00:52:09.534 --> 00:52:24.414
As a whole, but maybe did more work in the morning in the afternoon. You took some nap and then you did the remaining work in the evening. Okay. But if I calculate your work done and I divided by twenty four hours what is it?

327
00:52:24.414 --> 00:52:38.184
Giving me, giving me regardless of how you were working, you were working in the morning you, but in the evening you in the afternoon you were here in the in the evening you were here, it will average outright it will divide work done.

328
00:52:38.545 --> 00:52:51.715
Maybe you did hundred tools divide about twenty four hours. It will give you an average. But what if I want to many times I want instantaneous that add to particular incident of time what was your out? Which, how much walk you were doing.

329
00:52:51.775 --> 00:52:57.775
So, in that case, you have to time, have to use a different expression. D. W.

330
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:13.284
So this is, for a certain differential amount of time differential was done in the differential amount of time for certain work the amount of work that you did in a small interval of time.

331
00:53:13.704 --> 00:53:28.045
This is instantaneous follow in the British system. The unit of power is what's found per second often the horsepower it is used. So one what? That is the unit of power. These are the ESA units.

332
00:53:28.195 --> 00:53:39.835
Okay one what is equal to what is basically jewels for second because work is Jules and Delta. T. is in second units of power, or two for a second one tool per second is equal to one.

333
00:53:41.275 --> 00:53:51.655
It's also equal to point seven, three, eight foot pounds per second. Also horsepower is a very common unit. That is used one horsepower is equal to this much.

334
00:53:52.164 --> 00:54:01.614
In fact, when you talk about electricity and, you know, terminal mechanical engineers, mostly B, for electricity.

335
00:54:01.614 --> 00:54:13.525
Yeah, we do talk about wards and all that, but for machinery many times, it's like horsepower what horsepower of this and what horsepower of that this is equal to seven hundred and forty six watts it's very helpful.

336
00:54:14.094 --> 00:54:21.954
If you know, these two conversions, a one horsepower is equal to five decipher. So you don't have to memorize it. I'm not saying that.

337
00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:29.875
But what every day use, these should be like, on your fingertips as engineers especially those who are in mechanic.

338
00:54:36.474 --> 00:54:37.525
As an example now.

339
00:54:38.755 --> 00:54:46.764
And elevator cab of mass, and is equal to five hundred kg. Just sending with the speed is equal to for me a second.

340
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.094
What is supporting? Cable begins to slip allowing it to.

341
00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:09.085
For with constant acceleration by five. Okay. So so we have an elevator this one, it has a mass of five hundred kilograms. It is connected to an elevated cable here.

342
00:55:10.284 --> 00:55:16.525
Yeah, so it is sending with speed. So, this is initial speed.

343
00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:27.264
For me, just a second, it is sending it is going down when its supporting cable begins to slip something happens we support to give us start slipping.

344
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:37.824
So, what happens is that it starts flooding with the constant acceleration. Yeah, activation is g, by five in the negative direction.

345
00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:43.704
So, during the fall to the distance is equal to twice meters.

346
00:55:45.269 --> 00:56:00.144
Basically, previously, because it was held by cable, which was functioning properly a certain velocity was maintained for me, just a second once the why the cable slips now, it starts falling at some different acceleration.

347
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:14.994
So it is g by five previously, it was at a constant speed. Four meters per second when the speed is constant, there is no acceleration. It was not accelerating. It was falling sending at the constant speed. This is what happens in elevators, right?

348
00:56:15.414 --> 00:56:23.875
And you are the elevator why are you? So, comfortable, barely field, I mean, you to feel a little business moving it's not accelerating, right?

349
00:56:23.875 --> 00:56:36.625
Because it's moving at a constant speed, but if something happens to the supporting cable, it will start accelerating and accelerating downwards because the gravity is like, you know, it just pulling it towards it faster and faster.

350
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:52.284
So, now it falls to distance equal. Twelve me this question is, what is the work done on the cable by the gravitational force? So how much work is done on the way to cap by the gravitational force mind you.

351
00:56:52.344 --> 00:56:53.485
So, it is moving down.

352
00:56:54.835 --> 00:57:09.414
And the force of gravity is also down, so here we can draw three body diagram. So let's it. This is a gap. Then you wait till the tension in the cable. This is a force of gravity. Okay displacement is downloads.

353
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.764
Force the is doing negative work. He is opposite Judy.

354
00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:28.764
And in this case g is doing positive work because g isn't the same direction ask the same formula for times the space for start to displacement. And then cause of f. D.

355
00:57:28.764 --> 00:57:30.565
cause of f is.

356
00:57:31.739 --> 00:57:34.704
The week, right? So.

357
00:57:37.195 --> 00:57:49.974
Also the displacement and the force of gravity in the same direction. So, Peter, I would T and T they are an opposite. So their angle is hundred and eight.

358
00:57:53.034 --> 00:58:06.625
Causes zero, we can put the values and get the answer fifty nine, you know, jobs to be during the twelve me to fall. What is the work done on the cap? By the pool?

359
00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:20.454
The only way to keep it as we said, that the work done by. So cable in the opposite direction. So, cable is upwards. Tension is upwards the, the elevator is moving down.

360
00:58:20.454 --> 00:58:29.125
So cause when he, this would be the expression TD cause a file, you don't have to put a negative sign yourself if you put the right angle.

361
00:58:29.125 --> 00:58:36.264
If you put five, one, eighty, cause one, eighty is minus one in this equation is unknown.

362
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:49.914
You don't know what Steve previously this debate was a non quantity, but we don't know what these how can you find out? We can find out by newtons. A second motion is equal to mass timed acceleration.

363
00:58:51.150 --> 00:59:02.605
Says, pastimes acceleration. Okay. So f, negative positive minus negative pass times acceleration.

364
00:59:02.905 --> 00:59:14.454
By the way we are taking this as posit this says negative acceleration is done. Right? So, that way it is negative is basically this a value when you push a value of a, we'll put it as negative.

365
00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:26.784
You know, yeah, when you get into place with this plus so this is what you get now replacing the values. Okay.

366
00:59:28.019 --> 00:59:42.894
This is acceleration is g, by five you see here, they have written it as minus g. five reason is that it is acting downwards. Acceleration is downwards. So, in this equation sign conventions, these plus, mgi's this and a is negative.

367
00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:57.414
So negative putting everything. Five is one. Eighty. M. G. D. so you get the we get the negative work done minus forty seven C.

368
01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:17.875
What is the next work done on the gap during the full? The network is a some of the works done by the forces acting on the gap. This is a network done network done. Some of the two forces work done by G and work done by team.

369
01:00:18.445 --> 01:00:33.085
So, here it is calculated before you just take this. So, the network done is twelve. So the downward for the gravity is doing positive, still giving some resistance still trying to put up with. Although it is starting to slip.

370
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:49.735
So, but it is still moving, trying to move it in that direction. So, the net effort is reduced the network done is less if there was, no T, then the body will fall by this, you know, by nine point, eight, one meter per second Square.

371
01:00:50.099 --> 01:00:53.635
Right? But it does, at the moment, it does g by five g.

372
01:00:54.570 --> 01:01:01.704
Reason is that it's still offering some resistance is the caps kinetic energy at the end of the twelve meter.

373
01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:14.005
Okay, so we've calculated the total work done total work done should be equal to that change in the kinetic energy and there is a chain and the initial velocities for me just a second.

374
01:01:15.295 --> 01:01:29.664
And then the body was accelerating, right? So, there is a change in the kinetic energy. They are asking us at what is a final velocity they asking us the kinetic energy at the end. So, we can write down this expression work done is equal to change and the kinetic energy.

375
01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:36.385
Okay so, W, work done is equal to chain kinetic energy K. F minus K.

376
01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:48.235
So finding out K just rewriting it yeah. Will be this. Right? W, and when we get to sixteen.

377
01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.275
It's just

378
01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:17.215
so this is.

379
01:02:19.795 --> 01:02:24.445
This is related to kinetic energy. The next topic is related to the potential energy.

380
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:36.954
To me this sure. Five minutes straight. So you come back and.

381
01:02:40.139 --> 01:02:49.644
I will also add the next picture.

382
01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:40.824
Yeah, I'm giving a one or two again.

383
01:04:59.605 --> 01:05:03.925
I mean, I'm open to give other courses, but there are no students.

384
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:10.164
I can teach structure's structure, engineering related courses.

385
01:05:10.769 --> 01:05:24.474
So you don't have enough students in the summer for those well, that yeah, which courses you want.

386
01:05:25.494 --> 01:05:26.755
Are you in civil engineering?

387
01:05:40.045 --> 01:05:43.434
Yes, I okay. So.

388
01:05:45.235 --> 01:05:58.644
Which courses you want to take I mean, I took a look at the grief planner we have, I think structural design or mechanics. What's it called?

389
01:06:01.315 --> 01:06:12.744
Got I think it was mechanics of solid. Can you email?

390
01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:23.275
Dr catalyst okay. Okay. And check with him if, because he teaches mechanics of solid.

391
01:06:24.389 --> 01:06:35.155
So, you you guys, if you are enough, so, maybe they would open a section. And the thing is that usually Dr features discourse, but I can also teach this course.

392
01:06:35.304 --> 01:06:47.155
I mean, I've taught in many it's my courses also structure analysis, structural design, mechanics of knowledge. These are my courses.

393
01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:56.514
Okay, so you can discuss with them. I don't know if he's teaching in the summer or not. Maybe he's teaching so check with him. If he's.

394
01:06:57.929 --> 01:07:12.744
Teaching because the, the, the scheduling for the some of the offerings are so minimum. Okay. Basically talk to him. I will, I will send him an email and I will say that if he's not teaching that.

395
01:07:12.744 --> 01:07:22.014
Course, I can I'm also willing to teach other courses. Yeah, that will be great because we want to finish as much courses as we can.

396
01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:34.914
I think you need to be at least ten students that tends to this minute. Yeah. Or maybe twelve th, something like this. I at least you, if you are ten, you can make a good case.

397
01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:50.724
Okay, and we have to send like, one email to the girl. Yeah. Just send him an email and tell him that. I mean, but you have to, like, get in touch with other students also.

398
01:07:51.385 --> 01:08:03.985
Yeah, I know. Yeah. So maybe you can copy them in your email. And tell them that we have a certain group, and we would like to take the scores. Is there any whatever courses? I'm not saying just the scores.

399
01:08:04.885 --> 01:08:15.235
Is there any professor who can teach this? Course? So, I know that Dr capital. He normally teaches mechanics of solid and maybe he is teaching. I don't know.

400
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:29.545
So if he's not teaching, I can offer that, you know, I can handle the portion so much. I will I will I will get the consent from my, from the students first. I'm sure.

401
01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:33.805
In which.

402
01:08:36.175 --> 01:08:50.154
English discipline are you are you there.

403
01:09:30.119 --> 01:09:39.564
Okay, I'm gonna onto attendance now. Oh, okay. So which discipline are you.

404
01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:58.795
And civil or something else and what about her mom and which discipline are you.

405
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.960
Okay.

406
01:10:08.635 --> 01:10:14.125
It shows you so ID.

407
01:10:22.104 --> 01:10:22.585
Are you there?

408
01:10:45.625 --> 01:10:50.454
Yes. So your attendance is Mark I will continue.

409
01:10:55.015 --> 01:11:09.145
So, anyway, potential energy and conservation of energy. So another type of energy is potential energy in this topic. We'll also talk about conservation of energy. How energies can oh, energy? Oh, it it is.

410
01:11:09.145 --> 01:11:12.295
Transfer transferred from one form to another.

411
01:11:13.555 --> 01:11:28.404
But it is never really never zero or it cannot be created it cannot be destroyed. So, one system work done must be equal to another work done. This is also this is semi. You can eat the work done equation and the same. We ask observation of energy.

412
01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:32.635
Okay, so energy in should be equal to the energy.

413
01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:41.425
Potential energy there are two types of potential energy. One is a gravitational potential energy. Another one is elastic potential energy.

414
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:55.074
For the gravitational potential energy, I mean, it is the energy that is associated with the duration or arrangement of a system of an object and that exert force is on one another.

415
01:11:56.609 --> 01:11:59.425
So, we will talk about both energies one by one.

416
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:07.015
Gravitational potential energy is that, for example, let's say an object.

417
01:12:08.364 --> 01:12:12.324
Yeah, that's a, this is ground and this is a reference.

418
01:12:13.319 --> 01:12:19.555
You have an object, so you lift this object to a certain distance.

419
01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:29.335
So, it covered this much height for the potential energy stored. The system is equal to M. G. times each.

420
01:12:33.145 --> 01:12:46.914
So this is also equal to the negative of the work done and what you have done the masses acting downwards and you have given it a displacement of. So it is mass times displacement of.

421
01:12:46.944 --> 01:12:52.734
So it is forced time displacement. And because the, it is opposite, the sign is negative.

422
01:12:52.734 --> 01:13:04.494
So that's why the work done is negative gravitational force or the weight is acting down worse than a displacement is now you can say that I just said that energy cannot be created nor destroyed.

423
01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:17.305
So, when the object is stationary, it is at rest and then I'm saying that I'm moving it upwards. Am I not negating myself that here this is zero.

424
01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:29.694
Hey, this is H, right so MGE time zero zero. So that means object is having zero energy. So, how did we create this energy?

425
01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:40.225
Well, it depends where you references, how why is energy zero here? Because I'm taking this ground as my reference.

426
01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:52.074
If I change my preference, if I go to center of the, that is my reference, then the object definitely has some potential energy right? It is at some height.

427
01:13:52.795 --> 01:14:01.375
So we always have some potential energy you're sitting in your house have some potential energy. You have the potential to do some work.

428
01:14:03.685 --> 01:14:07.824
Now, I'm sitting in my I live at the eleventh floor.

429
01:14:09.119 --> 01:14:22.045
With respect to the flow, or? Yes, I have zero energy HS with a spy energy with respect to the flow with respect to the ground outside. I'm eleventh floor. Hi. What is my energy?

430
01:14:22.289 --> 01:14:25.645
Mge multiply by this these eleven fools height.

431
01:14:27.685 --> 01:14:31.074
How can I prove it? Well, I can try jumping out of the balcony.

432
01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:45.204
There will be work done. Trust me. So that's the work done. This is the energy. Yeah, you would just take my word for it and you also don't do this experiment transfer.

433
01:14:45.204 --> 01:14:48.354
You have energy potential energy stored in yourself yeah.

434
01:14:49.289 --> 01:15:00.895
So, it may seem like we're just sitting, we're doing nothing. We have no energy, but yeah, I know some anytime we say we are fasting. I'm fasting so I am with energy, but no, you do have energy? I have energy.

435
01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:10.015
Yeah, potential energy and we can test by jumping out the window. You will fall by a certain distance and something will happen. Some work will be done on us.

436
01:15:10.585 --> 01:15:18.449
Okay, so you never, really have zero energy, but yes, it, Wally with respect to your reference access. Okay.

437
01:15:18.925 --> 01:15:29.125
If I go on the twelve flow more work, I, I have more energy potential so if I go to the first floor, I have less stored energy with respect to the outside.

438
01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:37.914
But if I'm on the eleventh floor, and I measuring my energy with respect to the eleventh floor, then, of course, I don't have any potential.

439
01:15:39.329 --> 01:15:45.564
So, that reference very important and the choice of the reference makes absolutely no difference.

440
01:15:56.425 --> 01:16:02.154
What happened? So, this is gravitational potential energy. What about a spring energy that change?

441
01:16:02.154 --> 01:16:11.604
So, let's say you have a block, which is attached to a spring yeah, and initially it is at rest and she also initiate is here.

442
01:16:13.284 --> 01:16:27.864
As the block moves rightward, if the block moves in this direction in the right direction, the spring force does negative work on it. Of course, the, if the block is moving in this direction, the spring force is in the opposite direction.

443
01:16:27.895 --> 01:16:29.034
So negative work is done.

444
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.414
Similarly, if the block is moving in this direction, the direction of the spring force will be opposite.

445
01:16:37.824 --> 01:16:45.715
Okay, so, as a block move back, what towards X, the spring force does positive work on the. Okay.

446
01:16:45.715 --> 01:16:57.295
So, for the block, yes, it does positive work, but in terms of, in terms of potential energy, it is, it is going to be negative. The change.

447
01:16:57.295 --> 01:17:06.625
Then tell you in potential energy, which is a gravitational elastic is defined as being equal to the negative of the work done on the object by the force.

448
01:17:13.765 --> 01:17:28.255
This is on the object by the force. So we're talking about the spring for sure. We're not talking about the applied force apply force always does positive work in the direction of the displacement is the spring for that is opposite.

449
01:17:28.649 --> 01:17:40.225
Okay. Now, in this case, you can say if this is positive X, this is a positive X direction. Yeah. So, that's why it's the spring force it is doing negative work in the negative direction.

450
01:17:40.885 --> 01:17:52.854
So, here now it does if this is the positive X direction, the spring forces also in the same direction. So that is why we can say it is doing the positive work in terms of potential energy.

451
01:17:53.154 --> 01:18:03.685
So potential energy is always the negative of the work done. This is not for kinetic energy, particularly is of MV f squared minus half Square.

452
01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:04.380
So,

453
01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:09.895
if kinetic energy increases work done is positive if kinetic energy reduces work,

454
01:18:09.895 --> 01:18:12.024
done this negative potential energy,

455
01:18:12.835 --> 01:18:16.345
it's always the negative of the work done,

456
01:18:16.795 --> 01:18:27.505
or work done is always negative with the potential energy because potential energy it is a potential to do something is a very different energy from kinetic energy.

457
01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:33.295
So, let's say if I have a certain potential energy H.

458
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:46.524
If I jump out the back, any I'm going down, right? So, it's the opposite. My energy is used, it's converted it into something negative. The work done is being in the negative direction.

459
01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:59.305
Okay, so they are magnitude is equal, but sign is always opposite when it comes to the potential energy kinetic energy, as long as kinetic energy increases within a work done is positive.

460
01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:05.904
So we are now finished with our lecture time.

461
01:19:08.814 --> 01:19:15.324
I'm going to stop here this lecture the next week we will continue this and we will finish this topic.

462
01:19:16.944 --> 01:19:27.534
We'll do a couple of problems and then on Wednesday you will have a quiz and I want to do a trust problem with you. Right? And you need to practice on.

463
01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:34.345
I'm not going to solve some problems related to Central.

464
01:19:34.345 --> 01:19:48.175
It's so if you, I'm still, I'm going to stop this lecture and I'm going to start recording it again or the second half. So let's stop.

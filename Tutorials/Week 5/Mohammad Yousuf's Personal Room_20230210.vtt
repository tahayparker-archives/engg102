1 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:07.740
All right. Hello everyone, um, this video is intended to solve.

2 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.809
2 problems that I couldn't solve last tutorial online, and I hope by this recording, I cover all the steps required to.

3 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.560
Draw the sheer force and bending moment diagrams.

4 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.740
For any problem, and specifically here in this problem, or in this recording, I'm going to be solving 2 problems that involve.

5 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.590
Uh, linearly, very distributed load. So, uh, this is basically.

6 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.740
This, uh, linearly distributed load is probably the, uh.

7 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.180
Let's say the highest level that you can reach. Uh, and.

8 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.690
In this level, so I'm going to be solving 2 problems.

9 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:06.240
Uh, on these, uh, types of thoughts and same steps are basically followed for the easier parts for the easier. So, so I, I assume that you have covered lots of problems where you have just normal.

10 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.480
Uh, or a uniform the, this is the rectangular function.

11 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.460
So, I want to be doing more of the of these problems.

12 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.870
Uh, hopefully you can, uh, look at the later slides and.

13 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.010
The problems that you have solved in the in the assignment that should be enough. All right.

14 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:39.300
So, let's start, uh, starting this these problems it's always the same, which is basically to find the reaction. So, here I have simply supported.

15 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.180
I have 1 reaction here another action here. This is.

16 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.610
The why this is a way of course, we have, what is the we have some.

17 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.880
Be Excel, but it is going to be 0 So it's just a.

18 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:05.460
You cannot because we have no other forces in the X axis so to take, since we have to unknowns, I take this initial performance around 1 of the points. So points be.

19 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.080
Here's where I'm going to take the submission of moments and that should be equal to 0, the moments 1st of all.

20 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.540
Or before at the moment, let me just convert this valuable or this variable load into a single point load and.

21 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.570
Order to do that I'm gonna convert.

22 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.490
This whole thing into a single point load is single point act somewhere here.

23 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.820
What is the value of the value is.

24 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:39.690
Uh, basically the area of this triangle, so it is basically the base times the height.

25 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.690
Times half let's be half.

26 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:57.745
Times 1.5 times 3, which is equal to 1.5 times 1.5. That'll be 2.25 get an within this parameter. So this. two five get an within this parameter so this

27 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.660
This result can be converted to a single point load for the sake of finding the reactions.

28 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:16.650
So, what does it act? Exactly it acts at 4th of the distance? This is the role. So it is basically the synthroid of that shape. So the sensor is at 4th of the distance from.

29 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.560
The highest point so this will be 3 over 3. that would be like, 1 meter here. And from the other side, that would be.

30 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:40.920
2 meters, so this is basically me converting that into a single point code. And, uh, and now I know it's value and it's location. Now we're going to solve for the action. So, as I mentioned performance around point 0.

31 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.220
What I have here, I have this force that is causing a moment and this reaction both are causing moments around point can be. So, what is the moment.

32 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.400
That's caused by the 1st load. Uh, now it is pointing downwards and it is causing rotation.

33 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.510
Around that is, uh, basically contract requires, so it will have a positive value. That would be.

34 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.010
2.25 the value itself of the load times the distance between the load and point view, which is 1.

35 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.670
Okay, and then the other fours.

36 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:24.480
It will be basically causing, uh, rotation that is basically this way, which is clockwise. So that will be negative.

37 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:34.859
A lot of times the distance 3 times equal to 0 from here, I can find a why which is gonna be moved this other side.

38 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.679
Uh, 2.25.

39 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:48.419
For 3, 0 points.

40 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.029
75, the unit is keyed on.

41 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.269
All right now for.

42 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:02.369
Can just do submission of forces in the wide access. So.

43 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:10.649
That's equal to 0. uh, what do I have I have, which is 0 point.

44 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:16.139
75 just replace this with 0.75.

45 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:24.989
Okay, so +105andthen minus this 2.05.

46 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:28.079
And .

47 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:36.389
See, why this is equal to 0 is equal to 1.5.

48 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.429
Good, I notice. So I'm going to replace this and kind of put.

49 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:49.289
1.5, so these are my actions done. Let me get rid of this so I don't need anymore.

50 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:05:49.289 --> 00:06:00.149
Now, this is my problem I have the reactions everything is ready. Now, I am concerned with finding the sheer force diagram, and depending on on the ground. So let's take a step by step.

51 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:07.679
I need not to find the for so, let me just throw the access for that.

52 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.809
So, this and then.

53 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:29.699
This is my access for the sheer force diagram and same 1 just below it. That is for the moment.

54 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:37.589
So, here we have the Air Force and Newton, and they have the pending.

55 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:42.539
Moment and here are Newton's later. Perfect.

56 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:49.829
All right, so how do I deal with this problem now? This is going to be.

57 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:56.399
A problem that involves cubic and sorry uh, Square and cubic functions.

58 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:03.234
So it is not really easy to do it by hand, and just by inspection, cause it is not really straight lines anymore.

59 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:03.534 --> 00:07:15.624
It's basically curvatures and we have an inflection point, and we have a maximum points, and we have exact points where it should cross the X axis. All of these points are very important as you will see in the story. And so.

60 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:22.139
I need to find the function for this beam or the function for the.

61 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.559
Through this being basically. So what do I do I'm gonna draw just.

62 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:28.559 --> 00:07:35.699
The main section here, so so suppose I cut the beam at any, any place. So, uh.

63 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:43.649
I took a cut at that beam and this cat can be at any place.

64 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:47.939
Okay, um.

65 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:47.939 --> 00:07:51.059
Yeah, so here I have.

66 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:59.429
My reaction, which is 0.75.

67 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:03.929
And here I have the.

68 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:03.929 --> 00:08:12.119
And the pending moments, and on top of that beam, I have my variable load.

69 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:21.149
It's always going to be some other color, so my variable note. So.

70 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:24.719
Now, the, the big issue.

71 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:29.459
How do I convert this into.

72 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:34.379
Point that is function of X.

73 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:42.539
So, now this can be anywhere by the beginning cause basically at any X.

74 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.839
All right, so how do I convert it?

75 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:52.049
This load into a single point, though that is a function of X.

76 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:08:52.584 --> 00:09:06.444
Now, this cut, when I take it, I basically change the value of 1.5 according to where I did the cards. For example, if we took the cut right at the middle. So, this point is where I'm being sequence, which is 0.75 half the, the distance.

77 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:06.444 --> 00:09:10.614
All right. So. the distance all right so

78 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:10.979 --> 00:09:17.399
But it's, uh, the maximum point here depends on.

79 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:20.579
Or where I take the cut, but.

80 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:23.699
There's a general approach to this.

81 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:28.499
Okay, which is as follows Now suppose.

82 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:28.499 --> 00:09:31.499
That I took the cut at the middle.

83 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:35.939
What would be this value here to be? 0.75?

84 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:35.939 --> 00:09:39.119
Get a new perimeter.

85 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:52.139
And or, let's say the value of W, so I'm going to call this maximum point here, I'm going to call it, which is going to be 0.75 K Newton's parameter. And the length is 1.5.

86 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.319
Right. So.

87 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:09:55.319 --> 00:10:04.469
Now, uh, this is also the value now also support the ticket or I take the cut at quarter to the distance.

88 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:16.199
Okay, so I'll go with 1 more time. So this is basically some distance here at.

89 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:20.669
Half that distance. So here I'm going to have.

90 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:29.369
Very similar drawing, but slightly shorter and they have my sheet force and they have the bending moment.

91 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:29.369 --> 00:10:33.929
Or values and tenant forces, and they have my distributed.

92 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:38.729
That load will have a value of 0 point.

93 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:45.149
75 over, so she's 0.375.

94 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:56.459
Clear on new things perimeter and the distance here is 0.75. so if I want to make a relationship between.

95 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:59.969
This W, and the length a general relationship.

96 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:10:59.969 --> 00:11:04.379
What do I say? I, I can say that W, over X.

97 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:06.059 --> 00:11:09.269
For any given cut, whatever the cut is.

98 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:14.759
This race should W, over X, or let's say W, over the distance.

99 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:18.479
I think that has been made is.

100 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:18.479 --> 00:11:24.599
As you notice, it is always constant because the ratio of the triangles is always going to be the same.

101 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:24.599 --> 00:11:29.129
So, if I take the 1st drawing here, this 1.

102 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:34.919
What is the ratio of W over? Uh, X is going to be 1.5.

103 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:34.919 --> 00:11:41.609
Over 3, right I took the 2nd cut here, which is at the middle.

104 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:41.609 --> 00:11:50.789
I find it to be 0.75 over 1.5 and if I consider this 1.

105 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:11:50.789 --> 00:12:03.449
Can I find that to be 0.375 over 0.75 so what is common between all of this is that ratio is always the same, which is half.

106 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:09.569
Uh, so it doesn't really matter where I take the cut.

107 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:18.839
The ratio of Omega or is always half. So, this is basically what I really care about this half is what I need to find.

108 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:18.839 --> 00:12:22.619
So, instead of just taking the cut and.

109 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.159
It is basically simply just this load.

110 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:26.159 --> 00:12:30.809
That you find that for the maximum value over the distance.

111 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:30.809 --> 00:12:37.949
That is the issue of Omega, or which is 0.5 for this problem. 0.50.

112 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:46.949
This is very important because then I can say that for any given point, whatever that is W, is always 0.5 times X.

113 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:55.979
She's a very important outcome. So wherever the cut is whatever the verification of the internal force W, which is the maximum.

114 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:12:55.979 --> 00:13:04.139
Value in this distributed load is equal to 0.5 times instance, whatever or or whatever the distances.

115 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:09.749
Okay, so this is a very important outcome. So I care about.

116 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:17.489
Is so, let me reach this and consider my cut that is basically at.

117 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:17.489 --> 00:13:30.959
Any given point okay, the value of fix what whatever it is W, is always going to be 0.5 times X. and that is my general way of expressing the.

118 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:34.409
Distributed load at any given point.

119 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:39.599
All right now.

120 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:48.779
How to convert that into a single point load for the sake of finding the sheer force question so, that would be basically.

121 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:13:48.779 --> 00:14:00.179
A force here that has a value of again to the triangle. The base is X. the height is 0.5 X and times half. So a.

122 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:09.179
Times 0.5 X.

123 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:12.449
Which is equal to.

124 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:16.619
0.25 X Square.

125 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:16.619 --> 00:14:23.309
All right, so I'll just basically a negative value, so it's just pointing downwards but now, let's just find the value of.

126 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:27.539
So, enforce it in 1 X is equal to 0.

127 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:33.689
I have 0.75 I have -0.25 X.

128 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:33.689 --> 00:14:39.899
Square and then I have minus B, this is equal to 0. V. in this case is equal to.

129 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:44.069
-0.25 X Square.

130 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:54.359
Make this clear so 5 square +0.75.

131 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:14:54.359 --> 00:15:00.479
This is my share force equation. Now the sheer force.

132 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:06.839
The diagram is just plotting this function as simple as that just the functional asset.

133 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:10.139
Okay, so how do I do that? 1st of all.

134 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:10.139 --> 00:15:17.279
I'm gonna, uh, I'm gonna if it's, let's start with, uh, uh.

135 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:24.119
With the 1st load that I see here this is 0.75. so it is basically bringing up my curve.

136 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:24.119 --> 00:15:30.839
And a straight line 20.75 and then from this point.

137 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:35.699
I'm going to start applying this equation. Okay.

138 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:43.739
So, uh, how do I apply this the question now? 1st of all I know that my dog goes from 0 to 3 meters. So I'm.

139 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:43.739 --> 00:15:48.959
I should end up, or I should finish at, uh, at the end of.

140 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:56.699
The beam somewhere here. Okay, that's 1 information and.

141 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:15:57.989 --> 00:16:12.539
If I plot this now is basically a problem so it is square square function and it has a negative value, which means it will look something like this. Not really. Exactly. This could be something like this. Or it could be something like this.

142 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:18.359
All of these are negative, uh, Square functions.

143 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:26.309
So, negative square function means it should be it should be concave downwards. Okay so it is.

144 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:32.399
Something like this all this. All right so starting from this point.

145 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:48.329
Okay, uh, I have negative force, which is basically bringing back or bringing down the curve downwards, but it is slowly increasing. So.

146 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:16:50.034 --> 00:17:04.824
Um, it should start something or should do something like this, not sure exactly how exactly. But, you know, should do something like this. So, uh, it is now very important to know where does the curve meet the X axis.

147 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:14.309
Okay, that is the the point at which the sheer force is equal to 0. so whenever you find before you plot your.

148 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:18.059
Find the 0 point from this equation. So what.

149 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:30.299
Value of X, we'll give you a force 0, which means what other things you will have the intersection with the X axis. So send this to be equal to 0.

150 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:37.559
Which means X is if you solve this now, this.

151 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:41.609
This is important so solving it for X.

152 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:45.059
I get mine 0.7 and 5.

153 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:48.809
Divided by -0.25.

154 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:49.829 --> 00:17:52.979
Take this square root of this 3.

155 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:52.979 --> 00:17:56.999
And you get 1.73.

156 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:17:56.999 --> 00:18:05.399
Meters, so this means exactly at 1.73 meters. So, this is just after the half a little bit after the half.

157 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:10.019
So, somewhere here at this point.

158 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:15.089
There's 1.73 meters at this point. Exactly. I have.

159 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:15.089 --> 00:18:24.119
Intersection with the X axis, so it is a problem and intersects with this point. And this problem is a.

160 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:24.119 --> 00:18:29.939
Has a negative value, so it is basically give downwards. So it will look something like this.

161 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:46.799
Okay, but now, is this really accurate? I still don't know because, uh, what is my final value right? So, it could it could do something like this, or it could do something like.

162 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:55.919
This so I still don't know. Right. So how do I know I need to find the final value at which it hits the end of the beam.

163 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:18:55.919 --> 00:19:00.149
So, how do I do that? What is the value of fix here? This is 3.

164 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:08.309
So basically, substituting X to be equal to 3. so we, when X is equal to 3.

165 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:14.339
Is equal to substitute screen the questions. So 3.

166 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:18.119
To the power to 9.

167 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:27.299
Times 0.25+0.75, so I get -1.5 so.

168 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:35.039
This is 0.75 so, according to this, this should be something close to here. Maybe 0.75.

169 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:44.159
So, -1.5, so this is basically the point at which it would, it should be heading.

170 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:44.159 --> 00:19:51.299
Oh, sorry.

171 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:19:53.879 --> 00:20:04.739
Okay, so somewhere at this point, that is my endpoint and you can see now, I can just connect it using some sort of curvature.

172 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:18.959
And then, once I do that, I reach now that's basically I am describing the distributed load. Now I still have to add this reaction, which is basically bringing up the curve up by 1.5.

173 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:24.629
So this is -1.5+1.5 I'm going to reach 0.

174 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:24.629 --> 00:20:32.879
All right, so I start from JIRA and I end up with this is my curve. It makes sense. Looks nice.

175 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:32.879 --> 00:20:35.969
Okay.

176 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:44.879
All right now for the bending moment.

177 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:56.759
Okay, for the minimum, what do I do again? I'm gonna find the equation for this bending moment diagram. Let me miss this.

178 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:20:56.759 --> 00:21:00.599
This.

179 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:02.249 --> 00:21:07.019
All right, so let's take the summit of moments in this team around whatever point.

180 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:15.869
Around this point, so submission of comments 1st of all I have my own moment, which is this. I am here.

181 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:22.259
And then I have, uh, the moment from this point.

182 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:28.079
Which is basically causing rotation this way, which is also positive. So, here I have .

183 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:33.209
What is the Lord? The Lord is 0.25 X Square.

184 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.599
Times the distance.

185 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:42.149
From this load to the point at which it is causing rotation.

186 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:53.519
As you said, it is always 4th of the distance so that's 1 over 3 times X. so this is the whole distances x4th of that. That's excellent. That's.

187 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:21:53.519 --> 00:22:08.399
That is the distance alone. All right and then still have the reaction 275 disclosing negative rotation. So it goes this way, which is clockwise, which is negative. So -0 point.

188 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:12.659
75 times the distance, which is X.

189 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:17.339
This is equal to Sir now. Um.

190 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:21.209
Equation now for M, -0 point.

191 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:21.209 --> 00:22:24.749
Topic.

192 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:25.889 --> 00:22:29.609
Set up until 5 by 3 that's sent over. So let's keep it went over to.

193 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:38.999
X -0.75 X.

194 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:46.889
So, uh, now I want you guys to stop the video and.

195 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:46.889 --> 00:22:53.459
Try and find what is the relationship between the spending moment diagram the equation and the Salesforce.

196 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:22:54.779 --> 00:23:01.259
Between the moment, depending moment equation and the shift situation, what is the relationship between these 2 guys?

197 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:02.489 --> 00:23:11.909
You see some similarities, so think about it and for the video, and try to find it. Right. Uh, so in case you gave up.

198 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:14.939
Uh, the general rule.

199 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:21.989
In, uh, or the relationship between the moment and the is that, uh.

200 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:31.169
The, uh, Air Force is the derivative of the.

201 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:31.169 --> 00:23:35.249
Bending moment with respect to X.

202 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:42.839
Okay, so if you want to go from sheer force to pending moment, you basically integrate with X.

203 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:50.669
So, we could have just obtained this using just integration. You could just integrate this function and that will give me the same exact.

204 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:54.329
Result of course, with a constant, but since this is.

205 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:23:54.329 --> 00:24:03.179
Uh, exciting from JIRA. Uh, the moment starts from Jonathan. We don't have any questions.

206 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:06.599
Anyway, uh, same thing here.

207 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:11.339
You can notice that.

208 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:15.509
If you want also to think about it, what is the relationship between this.

209 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:22.379
And the sheer force, it's also very similar relationship, which is.

210 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:23.609 --> 00:24:27.059
Uh, W, is equal to .

211 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:30.599
The over the next.

212 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:30.599 --> 00:24:40.319
So also here by doing integration or integration, we can move from Salesforce to load function, which is.

213 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:47.939
Some of these relationships are basically a known and they are used.

214 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:55.319
Uh, to make our life easier so, instead of, uh, growing and.

215 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:59.759
During the manual way, you can basically just determine the.

216 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:03.149
The Lord function as a function of X.

217 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:09.089
And then find ve, which is, uh, the integration.

218 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:09.089 --> 00:25:14.519
This guy, oh, you can find in the moment, which is.

219 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:16.739 --> 00:25:23.639
Integration of this guy and so on. So, uh, this basically just like, uh.

220 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:28.439
This theoretical way of doing it.

221 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:33.779
All right, let's go back to the to the question. Now we have the bending moment equation.

222 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:44.579
And we want to plot dysfunction. So here we have, we have no concentrated moments. We have no moments that basically look like.

223 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:56.039
a moment in the middle of this team these are called concentrating moments so we have no constraints so this is basically should it should look like a continuous function from zero to zero

224 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:25:57.239 --> 00:26:02.699
That is the 1st thing I should notice since I have no concentrated.

225 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:08.339
Moments, uh, moment, we'll start from 0 to 0.

226 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:08.339 --> 00:26:13.649
In a continuous and smooth way. Now, the important points.

227 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:16.979
Is, uh.

228 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:16.979 --> 00:26:23.999
This point is very important. This 1.73, why is it important? Because.

229 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:30.359
When the share is equal to 0, this means it's integration has a slope of.

230 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:30.359 --> 00:26:39.479
So, this function will be some sort of, uh, a cubic function. So, cubic function in general.

231 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:45.209
They look like this.

232 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:45.209 --> 00:26:54.449
Okay, so, for the positive values on the associate X start from here and goes this way, so it should be some, some sort of a.

233 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:02.249
Basically minus X cube. Okay. It's minus. It is minus. So if it is positive, then it goes this way.

234 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:02.249 --> 00:27:07.259
Anyway, what am I here? Yeah.

235 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:12.239
So, uh, my function should be concave.

236 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:19.859
Downwards similar to the square, but not exactly. Square function. So it should look something like this or like this.

237 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:19.859 --> 00:27:23.369
Or, like, I I don't know or like this.

238 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:34.409
Whatever shift, but, you know, I know it is a cubic functions. I know it is negative. I don't know it is in the X axis. I know that I have no shift to the left, or right because they have no Constance.

239 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:34.409 --> 00:27:39.449
So all of these information determine.

240 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:39.449 --> 00:27:48.299
Or it gives me an idea and with some experience, of course, in in, I, I can determine or get a feeling how the.

241 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:27:49.194 --> 00:28:03.084
Or how the curve will look like now, that is the manual way of doing it. You can do this point by point taking X values in the small increments, and finding the values and putting the points just point by point whatever.

242 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:06.989
Don't do that if you want to let, you know, with.

243 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:10.049
With some experience, you can just immediately do it.

244 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:17.489
So, what is what are the important points here for the pending moment is the point at which the slot is equal to 0.

245 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:17.489 --> 00:28:24.599
So, when a function goes something like this, this maximum point where this is equal to 0, this is the.

246 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:28.829
This is the point that's what you the, the.

247 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:34.889
Derivative intersects the X axis and similarly, here we have.

248 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:34.889 --> 00:28:40.619
So, these points are, what I care about this is the maximum point in that in that curve.

249 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:47.639
So, it occurs here, but what is the value? Exactly need to find what is the value? What is the maximum value of this moment? So.

250 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:47.639 --> 00:28:51.029
Substitute this value into the bending moment the equation.

251 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:28:52.529 --> 00:29:01.649
So, what is the moment when X is equal to 1.73? Because, as I said, this.

252 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:01.649 --> 00:29:04.709
But you fix, we'll give you the maximum point.

253 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:04.709 --> 00:29:08.459
In that moment, so.

254 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:08.459 --> 00:29:12.449
1.73 to the 4.

255 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:12.449 --> 00:29:15.629
For the divided by 12-1.

256 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:15.629 --> 00:29:20.699
-0.75 times 1 point.

257 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:29.819 --> 00:29:34.019
what do i have this here i'm not sure

258 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:35.489 --> 00:29:42.389
Okay, so it is - minus none doesn't make sense.

259 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:52.979
Yeah, I guess something something wrong with the signs here.

260 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:29:55.349 --> 00:30:03.569
this becomes positive when i move this to the other side becomes positive so for this so

261 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:06.719 --> 00:30:10.889
173 2, 3, 4, 3.

262 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:10.889 --> 00:30:14.339
by that by twelve times minus one

263 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:14.339 --> 00:30:18.779
7.75 times.

264 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:18.779 --> 00:30:32.009
0.866.866 has a value of attendance.

265 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:33.089 --> 00:30:38.159
Meters so here in my curve, I'm going to go to a point.

266 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:38.159 --> 00:30:51.779
Is 0.866 and it is basically at an X value of 1.73. this point is my maximum point. So, here I have scope, which is equal to 0.

267 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:56.369
So, as I said, Mike.

268 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:30:56.369 --> 00:31:00.299
My function was set from 0, and it will end up with 0.

269 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:00.299 --> 00:31:06.389
And this in the positive, we'll look some, some sort of these shapes. So.

270 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:12.629
There's no, no other ship other than this 1 something like this. This is how.

271 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:19.799
Check your bank.

272 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:24.989
So that is my bending moment.

273 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:30.779
Right. So it is a cubic function.

274 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:34.919
And it is really hard to tell the difference or how to draw.

275 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:34.919 --> 00:31:43.529
uh the square and pubic function exactly but you know you can approximate the shape at least as long as the shape is right and these points

276 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:48.599
All right, then there's no reason why you should lose and increase.

277 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:57.449
Uh, all right, the other way of doing it if you, if you wanna actually of doing these stuff.

278 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:05.249
What you can do is basically just do the following, take this X and small steps.

279 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:06.839 --> 00:32:14.399
And for each X value, determine what is the moment and just put a point in another point point point, point, point point.

280 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:18.149
Finish the graph then connect the points.

281 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:23.849
And you will get the correct ship so it will just take more time. Um.

282 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:23.849 --> 00:32:33.449
but if you are uncomfortable of dealing with this stuff and just with the manual way and do the plots

283 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:33.449 --> 00:32:38.099
All right, so I'm going to stop this question and the other 1.

284 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:38.099 --> 00:32:45.119
What is the other 1? So the other 1 is also.

285 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:53.159
A question that is that needs a bit of work.

286 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:00.449 --> 00:33:10.139
So here this 1.

287 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:10.139 --> 00:33:16.199
Uh, as you can see here, this problem, I think this because, you know, the 1st, uh, reason is.

288 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:16.199 --> 00:33:19.319
It has.

289 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:21.209 --> 00:33:24.359
A concentrated moment and.

290 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:28.499
Linearly varying facilitate a lot.

291 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:29.939 --> 00:33:38.189
And the supports are not on the end. So it is basically some, some sort of a tricky problem let's say. So I'm going to solve it step by step here.

292 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:38.189 --> 00:33:45.149
Uh, the 1st thing to do is to find the reactions action here.

293 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:49.679
Action here.

294 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:53.009
I have 2 reactions, so he's taking some mention of moments.

295 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:58.019
Around point to a, let's see here.

296 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:33:59.909 --> 00:34:05.369
So, what are the forces? I have the concentrated load that.

297 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:05.369 --> 00:34:08.369
That is caused by this linear redistribute will not.

298 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:08.369 --> 00:34:12.089
This has a value of.

299 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:18.539
What's the area, which is half times? 30 times the distance 9.

300 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:18.539 --> 00:34:21.749
Which is equal to 515.

301 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:21.749 --> 00:34:25.919
Times 9, what about the value is.

302 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:34.349
Okay. All right, that's it. I think so. Let's take the moments at 1.8. this load will give you this 15.

303 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:38.039
Times and load, we'll give you a moment around.

304 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:41.609
Which looks like this, which is clockwise.

305 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:41.609 --> 00:34:51.359
That is negative. The distance is we said that is gonna be 4th.

306 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:51.359 --> 00:34:54.989
Distance, which is the same sort of, this triangle. So this is.

307 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:34:54.989 --> 00:35:02.159
3, and the remaining is 6. so the distance is 6.

308 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:06.749
Okay, uh, the next load we hit is this by the reaction.

309 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:06.749 --> 00:35:13.319
And it is causing rotation this direction, right? Which is, uh, contact requires.

310 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:13.319 --> 00:35:16.499
It's going to be positive be why.

311 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:16.499 --> 00:35:22.949
Times distance of 9 and then finally you are not done you have the concentrated load moment.

312 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:22.949 --> 00:35:26.009
Which is causing rotation.

313 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:26.009 --> 00:35:31.889
This way of course, this is -180.

314 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:35.549
This whole thing should should be equal to 0.

315 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:35.549 --> 00:35:44.909
From here sequence or 3 times 9 times 6 0.

316 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:48.809
180 overnight.

317 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:48.809 --> 00:35:54.569
So, 110 pounds and.

318 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:35:54.569 --> 00:36:00.119
Should be I'm going to quickly. Can do it. Uh.

319 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:12.299
25, you can do it step by step if you want consider this stuff to be easy. So, just to save time I am just doing it quickly.

320 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:14.849 --> 00:36:20.609
25, and this is 100.

321 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:20.609 --> 00:36:28.109
Of course, the units are pounds now we are done with this. Goodbye. Thank you.

322 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:30.029 --> 00:36:33.149
Throw the access to the.

323 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:38.184
Sure force

324 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:38.934 --> 00:36:53.004
live.

325 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:36:54.269 --> 00:37:02.669
Okay, this is the force and the units are pounds since the bending moment.

326 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:02.669 --> 00:37:06.269
And in pounds, what.

327 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:08.939 --> 00:37:14.729
Okay, so let's start, uh, as you said, what do we do we take 1st of all this.

328 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:14.729 --> 00:37:24.209
2nd, okay. Um, all right, I think we are good. Uh, the 1st thing is to convert or deal with.

329 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:27.599
Or find the equation for this, this, because.

330 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:39.029
That will help me, uh, plot the sections where this this table code is acting. So, the 1st thing is this load I need to find the equation for that.

331 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:42.389
So that I can plot, uh, easily.

332 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:44.964 --> 00:37:58.344
All right, so let's consider this cut, which is basically taken somewhere in the middle here and remember what we said cost in the last problem how we deal with such problems.

333 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:05.339
So, what we have here is the action, which is 25.

334 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:05.339 --> 00:38:08.879
And we have a distributed load.

335 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:12.420
And you said that, David you here.

336 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.340
Is equal to, um.

337 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.710
3rd sorry, uh, let's say.

338 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:30.030
Over X is equal to 30 over 9. that is the constant.

339 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.670
The concentration that will be basically at any given value effects.

340 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:41.160
No matter what the, what the benefits the issue is gonna be the same, which is 39.

341 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:46.950
And this is basically 31,903.

342 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:52.770
Let's see what that sent over 3, which is 10 over 3. so, from here.

343 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:57.210
They will do is equal to 10 over 3 times.

344 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:07.140
That is my value of W, wherever I am in the name, I can be anywhere and that is under this load. She's the value of the.

345 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:17.010
Which is 10 over 3 X and the distance is also at a distance and I have my and.

346 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:22.410
Pending moment, and now I am good to go. Of course, I need to convert.

347 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:28.440
This this will be plugged into a single point. So it will act.

348 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.580
Right here the value of this force is.

349 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.700
The area of the triangle, which is.

350 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.150
Times, 10 over 3.

351 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:47.160
X times X, which is, um, 5 by 3.

352 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.580
X square yeah.

353 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:02.100
And the distance, it acts at 4th distance from the maximum point, which is 3 X here.

354 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.190
And this distance is.

355 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:13.470
2 over 3 X. all right so now I am. Good to go. I can find what is the force equation? So let's do it.

356 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:18.270
Cheerful submission of forces in why is equal to 0 So 25.

357 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.260
-5 over 3 X Square.

358 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.000
P2 P is equal to.

359 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:31.890
-5 or 3 Square .

360 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:36.240
25, that is my sheer force equation.

361 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:43.110
So, for that segment, only I can immediately just find the moment, which is going to be, as you said, because you're going to be the integration of this guy.

362 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:52.590
So, we can, uh, uh, that would be 509. so 5.

363 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.250
Over 9 X +25 X this is.

364 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:01.765 --> 00:41:13.675
My moments question, of course, these equations are not for the entire beam. These questions are only under this distributed load. Right? So it helps me plot.

365 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:14.065 --> 00:41:26.755
How does the or the vending moment? How does how does it look like under this load? Only but for the rest of the beam is basically simple and straightforward. So there's no need to find the equations for the rest of the day. So, in general.

366 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.410
You need to find the equation for every single segment in that way.

367 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:40.200
All right, so we have different functions for every single segment. These questions are only for, uh, uh.

368 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.160
All right, as you said, what do you care about or.

369 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.350
What do you care the most in these questions care about the value of X.

370 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:57.900
When we is equal to 0, that is basically the intersection with the X axis. So what is X.

371 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.340
X is, uh.

372 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:07.680
503 good. Sorry.

373 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.080
25 times 3 over 5.

374 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:19.620
Square root so X is 3.87.

375 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:33.420
Put this point, I have an intersection of the sheer force with the exception. So, this is a very important point. So, let's now, uh, do the force.

376 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.540
1st of all, I go up by.

377 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:42.840
25, so, let's mark this. Let me just, let's leave it alone. Maybe this is 25.

378 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.390
Okay, and from this point.

379 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:56.820
I'm gonna mark the 3.87 so that will be approximately 3rd of the distance.

380 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:02.010
She's basically approximately here, I'm not really being exactly this point.

381 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:07.050
So, is 3.73.8.

382 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:12.510
7 foot, so I know that my curve now is.

383 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.800
It's a, it's a square function that will basically be passing through this point.

384 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:25.980
And it ends up with, um.

385 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:42.565
1st of all. Uh, so this is a square function, right? And it is negative so it will be concave down somewhere like this, or something like this or something like this. All of these are correct chips as long as it is concave down. That is correct.

386 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:42.565 --> 00:43:43.675
So, we need to know that.

387 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:52.110
And it starts from this point, it passes through this point, and it ends up with what points. So, at 9 0.

388 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.460
It's fine, what is the value of the Salesforce? So.

389 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:02.220
Uh, what is the, when X is equal to 9?

390 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:08.070
So, 503.

391 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:15.330
Times Square that's 20-25.

392 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:23.460
That's -1 is -110somark. The point of -110.

393 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:34.800
And 9, this point here that is where the code will look like, or it will pass through these 3 points and it is parabola. So it is concave downwards.

394 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:41.010
So this looks like a straight line, although it is not really. So my, my skills are not really correct.

395 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:47.250
Look something like this. Okay let's move this point for the sake of science.

396 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:54.300
Let's move it to the right so that you can actually show the slope.

397 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.570
Or the behavior of this graph, what.

398 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:08.610
Anyone wants to keep it, right? So it is a curve that.

399 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.360
Points or this.

400 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.350
A curve is it is a curvature. There's a coverage that's points.

401 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.520
Or the, uh, it's concave downwards.

402 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:29.100
All right, so that is basically the question for the distribution load. Now, I'm done with this. Now. What is the next step? Is this load.

403 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.470
Which is bringing me up by 110 so I am at .

404 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:39.420
110, I grew up by 110. I reach 0.

405 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.770
And then after that in the game, I have no other goats.

406 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:49.740
So, it goes constant until the end of the game.

407 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.610
And that is my share force.

408 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.580
Okay.

409 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:09.300
So the next part is to find the bending moment. So I have the equation for that segment, or which is the hardest 1.

410 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:16.200
And keep mind guys keep in mind that you have this concentrated, um, momentum. So don't forget about it.

411 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.380
So, let's let's start from 0 here.

412 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:26.070
No, I have no concentrated load, so it starts from 0. it goes up down whatever it starts from. 2.

413 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.600
And, uh, what is the shape it is?

414 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.700
A negative cubic function, so.

415 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.440
We have no shift. So this guy.

416 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:50.550
This negative, so it is some sort of this shape. This 25 X might make it something like this. So I'm not really sure.

417 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.560
Maybe we have to we have to test the values and see.

418 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.360
Anyway, 00 that's put, uh.

419 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.590
Let's put the value of 1 here. See what we get.

420 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:10.110
So, 1, that is minus so I get it up. So it goes it goes up.

421 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:13.140
It goes up and then down probably.

422 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:20.490
All right, so it goes up to what point to a maximum point where does the maximum points of your guys.

423 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:27.120
Because at the intersection in the sheer force.

424 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.270
So, then the section means that the.

425 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:36.120
The integral of this point has 0, which means it goes.

426 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.970
This way flat on top, which means the maximum point. So I need to find.

427 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.740
I need to find what is the moment.

428 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.520
When X is equal to 3.

429 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:04.350
Point 87, so 5 over 9 times 3.870 to 4 3.

430 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:14.700
-1+25 times 3.87. so 64.50.

431 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.570
Maximum value here I'm going to reach is 64.

432 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:26.130
Point 5, and to go up.

433 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:29.550
So, at this point, at 3 at 3.

434 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:45.990
Point 87, I will have this value, so it will pass through this point from this point to this point somehow. Okay. Let's find the other points. Now. Uh, the, the other important point is where it will end.

435 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:56.130
So, let's see, uh, let's find the value of the moment at 9. so at 9, let's see what.

436 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.060
Well, the point is, and then we can start connecting the dots.

437 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:06.840
So, um, the moment when X is equal to 9.

438 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.210
509 times.

439 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:19.350
Hi, queue time find this 1+25 times 9.

440 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:20.485 --> 00:49:35.335
-20beautiful? Yeah, nice. -180hereand. The point is exactly here. So I go up. Of course, it is concave downwards and this is. course it is concave downwards and this is

441 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:45.300
That is my bending on the diagram. I am not done yet. By the way. This is only for.

442 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:57.330
Which section, uh, this is for the, uh, for the section at which I have description. Now, I have to continue Adobe. So, after this point.

443 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:05.520
Do I have any other moments now? There are no concerted moments.

444 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.770
And my share, my shift function is.

445 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:14.280
0, which means it has no area so there is no.

446 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.730
Change in the value of the moment so it keeps.

447 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.780
Straight line until I hit.

448 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:26.670
The end point, which is a concentrated moment.

449 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:34.080
It is a negative moment, which means it will be bringing me up by 180 points. So from -1 and 80, I go up.

450 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:38.070
2+180 this is 1-180.

451 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:41.790
I go up by +180 and.

452 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:45.840
This is, uh, correct.

453 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.160
Because I start with 0 and either withdraw for both and diagrams.

454 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:50:54.090 --> 00:51:00.210
So, I hope this helps so the most important thing here is to how to find this the blue guy.

455 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:04.320
Once you find it, then you can find the functions and from the functions.

456 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:19.195
It's basically about to practice, and most of the functions will look very similar by the way, unless you have a load that is basically the opposite direction. So, basically, the same thing with the signs are going to be different.

457 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:51:19.315 --> 00:51:24.835
The shape of the curve is gonna be different. So, the key here is to practice in my opinion.

458 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:29.550
All right, so, uh.

459 "Mohammad Yousuf" (339929344)
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:35.424
I'll stop here and there was you guys good luck in your exam.
